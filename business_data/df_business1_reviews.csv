Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,The double cheeseburger is delicious. The service is very welcoming. I will be back to try the fried rice!,Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,4,Tried this spot here while in town on business.  Great burger hand formed with very fresh veggies and delicious fries.  My only critique would be to fry the fries just a bit longer.  Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu.  Service was quick and polite.,Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,"I had the pleasure of eating here today for the first time. Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. It has an awesome ""small business"" feel to it. The owner came out from the kitchen to thank us for coming in. I work right across the street, so I'll be visiting this place on a very regular basis. They have a hot wing challenge that I'm planning on attempting in the near future. To the owner of this place (I'm sorry, I never got your name), keep up the great work!",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,Read a review in the Riverfront Times so I decided to swing by. Cutiest little dinner.  The staff was friendly and inviting. The menu was full of tasty items but I tried the special fried rice and was pleasantly surprised. It tastes great. Can't wait to try some of the other menu items.,Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,"I called in my ordered of Special Fried Rice on a Saturday. I was told it would be ready in 15mins. & it was,only problem,when I arrived a Large Pit Bull was tied to the door handle of the restaurant which prevented anyone from entering! Come to find out a customer did it because he didn't want to leave his dog in his vehicle(STUPID)! The owner was very upset once he found out and made him leave! He apologized the entire time I was there! He & staff were very friendly & talkative,LOL! The Rice was Very Good considering it's not really a Chinese Restaurant! As a matter of fact they're better than some I've visited! The only complaint I have is they could have put a little more meat in or have larger pieces! I definitely will return and try what they mainly Opened for, ""Burgers""! 

P.S. I did call twice,earlier in the week,and was told they weren't selling any Rice at that time! You almost lost me! If it's on the Menu then you should be ready to Sell when you Open! You're setting yourself up for ""Failure""!",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,The food was really great! I got the philly and my wife got the chicken bacon ranch. Friendly waitresses. Great selection in music. It's not on the menu but they also serve cakes!,Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,"The experience was wonderful! The food was great, service was smashing, the staff was friendly and accommodating. Nay Nay, our server, was great, checking on us and ensuring we had a great dining experience. The cheeseburger on a brioche bun with pepper jack was wonderful. My mouth is happy!",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,"I live in south city and I HATE driving to Noco...
But...
I will gladly make that drive at least twice a month for the Kinloch Big Box of fried rice minus the pork.
And the turkey burger is juicy and seasoned well, and delicious af!
Friendly staff welcoming environment!
Love this place!",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,3,"I got my food super quick, the shrimp dish and the shrimp was huge and filling, but it lacked a little seasoning. The fries were awesome, though and I would come back again !",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,4,"i had the wings...full wing getting 3 order is like getting 6 at others places...highly recommend the hot and honey...wife had burger that was great...good
service highly recommended will be. back soon",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,4,"Second time visiting Big Boyz and I can say they have done great job with food and service. I had the Kinlock fried rice that was packed full of meat, Hot and fulfilling.",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,Really good wings and seasoned fries. I got the honey hot and it was really good.Be prepared to wait for like 20 min tho.,Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,This place was very good and we had a great time. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. We got to meet the owner and he was very friendly as well. The food came out quickly and was full of flavor. It is just a small ma and pa shop near the airport. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for somewhere to eat. I will definitely be back!,Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,5,"I heard so many good things about this place so I had to check it out for myself. I was impressed with how clean this place is and all the workers are extremely nice and greeted me. I ordered and cheeseburger and it came with cheese fries. I was happy i didn't have to go extra for toppings like tomatoes, onions, and pickles. Food was well seasoned and cooked fast but fresh. I will definitely be returning.",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,4,"I visited Big Boyz because they are close to me and I heard good things about them. Well, they did not disappoint. The first time, however, they had ran out of the fried rice for the day, but the young lady at the counter said it usually goes around lunchtime to 2:00. I did try the garlic parm chicken wings and they were so good. The fries were nice and crispy as well. I did get a chance to try the rice on another visit and it was delicious.",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,1,"Honestly disappointed! I heard so many great things about Big Boys, to my surprise it was sub par at best.Our fries were burnt, the breaded chicken seemed over cooked and it wasn't very flavorful, I could have just fried chicken and made a hamburger at home. There was nothing really special about the Big Boy burger, it just tasted like a burger you'd get from Applebee's only slightly bigger. To top it all off it was as cold as outside inside the building! Won't be going back.. I lowkey want my money back. Very disappointed!",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,2,"Stopped in to show support. The atmosphere was ok for a local dive. Regular tables to sit at and even had a counter with bar stools. However it was cold inside not sure if the heat was broke or they just didn't have it on. So after placing our order we went back outside to wait in the car. The owner and workers were very pleasant. Even tho they had a little mishap right before we came in. They apologized and worked around the situation to get our order.
Not knowing what we wanted to try 1st we chose a little bit of everything. I started off by ordering the Monster philly but they were out of steak and offered the chicken philly which I declined. Instead I got their special fried rice which was supposed to have shrimp, chicken, and turkey ham. However they were out of shrimp! No worries they substituted beef instead. I also got the chicken St Paul. My son got the wings(plain)and fries. My hunni went for the 4 patty burger(I forgot what it was called)and also some plain fried rice. As the owner boasted how good it was and how he had put the chinese restaurant around the corner out of business! The food was prepared quickly and we were on our way. The aroma thru out the car smelled amazing so we couldn't wait to get home to eat! Let's start with the rice..terrible! It was dry and did not have that distinctive chinese taste. Tasted just like a box of white rice with meat, egg, beansprouts, green peppers and onion. No flavor at all. The St Paul was the worst. It tasted like greasy eggs. 2 bites 1 from me and the other from my partner then it was in the trash! However my hunni really enjoyed his burger but said the fries were trash which he fed to the dog. Last but not least the chicken. My son and I both agreed they were seasoned and fried just right. However they did taste like they were fried in old grease! Will we return?? Maybe, but I would suggest they stick with the basics and leave the chinese food off the menu please. Also they need to stock more of what they sell mostly which seems to be the steak philly. Nice place but I wasted $41.00 on nothing special.",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,3,"Went for the rice one day, he said it would be ready in 30 minutes. I didn't have time and I don't eat meat so there was no other option I wanted. Went in a week later and they said no rice at all. Won't be a third time. I tried to support but can't.",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,2,First time visiting Big Boys because it is black owned and I love supporting black business. I'll keep it real in my review:   Wanted to try the special fried rice but at 1 pm they said fried rice wasn't available?  One of my pet peeves is when an establishment doesn't have what's on the menu. I understand running out of an item late in the day but this was lunch time. The wings I had were like wings I would make.  Only advise is to ensure the ladies taking orders are more friendly and professional to customers.,Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,4,"Good place but a little hard to find.  We were the first ones in the door at noon and the place was virtually full by the time we left.

There aren't a lot of places other than fast food where you can get lunch for six bucks.  This is one of them.  For $6 you get a double cheeseburger that's quite respectable and an order of fries.  In this day and age, that ain't bad!

The burger was good.  They smash the meat into the grill so it has a nice, hard sear to it.  The cheese gets a bit melted and gooey while the bun is substantial enough to hold all of it together as a sandwich.  They hit the fries with seasoned salt.  I'm not a fan of that stuff but some people swear by it.",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,2,"Not the best experience, I've heard good things about this place but the service and the cashier (Brittany) was not pleasant on the phone or when I went to pick up the order. And to top it off the order was wrong .",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,3,"So the food itself was great, and I had it to go.  I had the bacon cheeseburger on sour dough and an order of cheese fries.  The fries were hot and crisp even after the drive home and the burger was tender and delicious. The atmosphere in the restaurant was interesting.. 

The cook either didn't understand or didn't care that his complaing could be heard in the front of the house.  The young ladies who were taking orders assured us in the dining room that he wasn't complaing about us--several times. They stepped back into the kitchen time after time, it would seem, to tell him he could be heard.... It didn't seem to have any effect on his behavior. To the point one young lady was shaking her head and saying ""that man"" over and over. 

I'm glad I didn't stay longer than it had taken to get my food prepared. It got to the point of being uncomfortable.  I'll definitely come back but not sure that I'd dine in. The dining room is cute and clean but listening to employees complain isn't quite the ambiance I'm looking for when paying to eat out.",Big Boyz Burgers and More
Jv8lYSZPxY0rzkSpgo7BIw,2,"I gave Big Boyz a try today. I went in initially because I wanted to try the fried rice. What a disappointment to hear that it was unavailable. I ended up ordering 3 bbq wings and 3 breaded wings, 1 regular fry and 1 cheese fry (fries aren't included with the 3 wings) I assumed the fries would be in separate containers but they put them with the wings without even asking which fry went with which flavor of wing. Needless to say their guess was wrong. Anyway the food was just ok...$15.32 for 6 wings and 2 fries...they're definitely overpriced!",Big Boyz Burgers and More
