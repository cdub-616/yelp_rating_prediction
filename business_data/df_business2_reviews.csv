7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,5,"Just like Chipotle! Food was great, very filling,  tasty,  and I got it quick. Everyone was nice and polite and they take Temple Diamond Dollars which is always a bonus for a student. The other night I came in to use the restroom without buying anything and they didn't care at all.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,2,"I love Qdoba but this is kinda dirty, especially behind the counter. Comparing it to the one on City Line Avenue. That's a great one in service & cleanliness.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,5,"Best burrito place in the world. Better than any real Mexican place. Better than chipotle, California tortilla, moes, baja grill, etc. if you don't like it get outta my face. Queso chicken burrito for life. Also has Choulua hot sauce which rules and Chipolte has tobasco which sucks ass",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,5,I like it.  the enviornment is clean and food is fresh. I had their taco salad with grilled chicken. The service is fast too.  pricy I know. if only they are cheaper I will show up more frequenctly.,QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,2,"I eat here often and i love their tacos, but the girl at the checkout counter today at 2-2:30pm was very rude. Guess i will visit chipotle from now on",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,2,"Let's face it, Qdoba is not where you should go if you're craving *real* Mexican food. But for those of us who work close by and are craving something other than the tuna sandwich that we brought for lunch, it's an OK choice.

My gripes are as follows:

1. It's way too expensive for what you get. You want a side of guac, which will turn out to be a negligible amount anyway, be prepared to refinance your house. You want something other than water to drink? Prepare, again, to dig deep in your wallet.

2. The lines and crowds. Yes, I get it. This is on/near a college campus. That doesn't make me any less annoyed when I walk in and the line is to the door.

3. Seating. Obviously with the crowds seating will be at a prime. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're not.

4. The food. It's not very flavorful, but that's to be expected with a chain restaurant. 

My general advice is if you're not feeling like eating your tuna salad or egg salad or ham and cheese...choke it down and then reward yourself with a Mexican dinner at one of the really GOOD spots in Philadelphia. And while you're there, grab a margarita, too!",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,"Fast-casual burritos, clean restaurant, friendly service, fine place for cheap, quick lunches.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,5,"Qdoba is the best chain-Mexican I've ever had and this location is on point all the time. Their food may be prepackaged and frozen at some point, but I would rather have this kind of chain than a McDonald's or some other giant. It should certainly have more than 3 stars as an average; try the chicken quesadillas if you're looking to try them for the first time!",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,4,"Down with Chipotle, in with Qdoba. Seriously, I'm a huge Qdoba fan. Service is pretty average. Not amazing not terrible. It's great Mexican food. And is so good! It won't disappoint at all. However, it's still a little pricy. Not a big fan of that haha. Not a place I would travel to either. I don't think my I've ever craved Qdoba before. It's just been a  ""oh look Qdoba, I guess I'll go there"" sort of thing.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,2,"It's nice to have a nice, filling option close to where I live, but Qdoba is really nothing that you should travel very far too. I think I prefer Taco Bell!",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,"I was in town for a short visit and decided to grab a bite to eat off the side of Temple's campus. The restaurant seemed safe enough.. a few students, a few older folks, and a decent flow of others taking things to go. I had an interview the next day so I thought why not! Nothing like a burrito assembly line to keep me fueled until the next morning.

The food was delicious while I was eating it. However, the problem came later that night... throughout the night. It seems that I had gotten food poisoning from something in the burrito I ate. Long story short, the next few days and flight home weren't the most enjoyable. I hate to give it one star because the queso burritos looked pretty amazing, but I'd hate more for the same fate to fall upon another innocent soul.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,5,I eat here quite frequently it's always clean and the food is always fresh the workers are always nice and very professional,QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,"Much better than Chipotle. Can you believe they're just now getting queso there???

I come here a lot. The parking meter machine in the back is always broken yet they still tow cars so I feel like I'm living on the edge when I can't find street parking. Most patrons are Temple students who don't have to worry about this though.

Last time I came it was 95 degrees out and no AC inside. No lemonade or sprite in the machine. I expect better of a chain restaurant!

But all in all they make the burritos that I love. Sometimes wrapped better than other times depending on the worker. I'm always gonna come here once a week to get my fix anyway.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,4,"Qdoba is like Taco Bell in the same way that Beethoven is like Nickleback. This is authentic Mexican cuisine served in an intimate setting by some of the most professional waitresses that I have seen in my culinary career. This is the stuff that restaurateurs dream about. I'd advise ordering at least three entrees and requesting seven to twenty extra trays so you can set up your own little tapas tasting menu. Sure, it might cost 70 bucks, but have you gone to a tapas bar lately? Stop questioning me? Maybe I'm smarter than you? Maybe there's a reason that I'm the semi-professional food critic and you are not? Get the gumbo. Get at least two burritos. Get a damn quesadilla. And if you order any of these without extra queso, you are a chump and a disappointment to mankind. Heck, I order extra queso for my Sprite. But, I do have a bit of a refined palate. By the way, steal as much Tabasco from the tray by the soda machine. You can steal at least five bottles a visit. You deserve it.

NOW, STOP. You're not the king of 'rito town. You can't just start shoving that tortilla nonsense into your mouth like my ex-girlfriend Nancy on her diet cheat day. You'll look like a stupid, dumb idiot. You need to douse this cornucopia of diarrhea-fuel with Tabasco until it looks like the money shot in an adult film. This is authentic, my friend. You've stumbled on some secret Mayan shiznit or something. Welcome to El Dorado. If any of your meal is not sopping wet with hot sauce, you have wasted your money, just like how Nancy used to waste my money.

All-in-all, the Qdoba is a masterpiece of ethnic dining and a fantastic night out for young lovers or a remedial community college Spanish class. I miss you, Nancy. I'm sorry I was so selfish.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,4,"I love Qdoba. And therefore I love this place. It's right up the street from the movies, so right after me and my friends go for a flick we can head right up the street and go here. I love the big portion sizes you get for the amount of money you pay. $6.75 seems like a lot but it's definitely worth it for the portion size you get. We usually split the chips and get a soda to wash it down with it. Just make sure you eat it slowly. You might end up with the Qdoba effect--gas, feels like you're about to puke-the general overeat feeling. So be careful with your glutiness.

EDIT: The ""it"" I'm talking about is the burritos.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,5,"Wheneve I'm in the mood for Mexican food, which isn't often, Q'Doba is my go-to spot. Well, it may have just given my tastebuds a little boost seeing as they hv online ordering and they actually have it ready on time. Their burritos are my favorite because they're so filling and satisfying. The staff are always nice and pleasant and the atmosphere is pretty chill. This location is convenient to everything, the train, multiple buses and on a nice weather day it's popping. I've tried the Chipotle and I'm gonna stick with my Q'Doba. (It's funny bc it seems that I can't ever find anyone who likes them both. It's an either or with these two lol)",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,"It's Qdoba.  There isn't much more to say.  Average Mexican food for a decent price.  Seating is nice and the atmosphere is okay, but I find Chipotle to be an overall better experience than Qdoba both in general and in comparing this location to the nearest Chipotle in center city.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,"The customer service is always great. 
It's clean all the time.
The food is pretty decent. 
But today I found something metal in my vegetarian quesadilla. Luckily I wasn't chewing like a horse and didn't damage my teeth. I usually don't have things like this happen to me... if only I found a winning lottery ticket in my quesadilla.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,Pass on this location sub par staff and rude cashier Tanisha I believe her name is. Very poor service for a place on temple campus. See my Google review as well.,QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,"I went here with some friends a few weeks ago. Being from New Jersey, I've only had the chance to experience Qdoba about two or three other times at different locations and had great experiences with both the food and service. Unfortunately, this trip went a little differently. 

I walked into Qdoba at around 2 o'clock, just before the Temple rush. There was no line and I was helped immediately. Since I am extremely unfamiliar with their menu, I took about 5 seconds to browse it. (The only menu in the store I might add, located behind the counter above the cashier.) This angered the first member of what later turned out to be an assembly line of assholes. After making a condescending/sarcastic remark about me not knowing what I wanted, he proceeded to place my grilled chicken into a wrap and slide it to asshole #2. 

Asshole #2 introduced herself to me by mumbling a noise I couldn't understand, after politely asking her to repeat what she had just muttered, she blurted out 3 salsa options to me in a very rude demeanor. I chose my salsa, apologized (again) and continued with my order. She continued to fill my burrito with the contents of my choosing and moved down the line. As we got to the end, I made a final request for some rice. Rather than taking the 2 seconds in would take to put a scoop of rice into my burrito, she angrily said ""OH NOW YOU TELL ME"". I assumed she had to have been joking, but it turned out I was wrong. I again apologized and got nothing in return. Extremely annoyed, she then proceeded to slide my tray to Asshole #3.

Asshole #3 blurted out the 11 dollar and some change total that my order had come to and handed me a cup that I never ordered. Feeling very uncomfortable and almost bullied, I handed him cash, got my change, waited for the thank you I never got, and left the line feeling about the same size as the brain of the person who manages this fine establishment, very small. 

As I approached the soda fountain to fill up the cup I never ordered and was charged for, I was greeted by a bucket of ice, an uncovered container of cut lemons, and an enormous family of flies that decided to land all over both. 

Disgusted, I sat in the nearest booth and waited for my friends. The wall my booth had been up against was COVERED in food residue. I don't know if a food fight had gone on between the degenerate employees before I arrived or what but the flies sure didn't seem to mind. 

I know what you're probably imaging me as right now and I honestly am not that. I am a hardworking 22 year old that just wanted a chicken burrito. My ordering process took literally about 45 seconds at the most and could have been 15 seconds with a positive, smart, and polite employee working that day. I will never walk inside a Qdoba again and it really is a shame because that burrito was BANGING.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,"Don't come here during lunch/dinner rush! 

The food is okay. If you have never been to Qdoba before, they have the regular Mexican-chained foods: burritos, tacos (3), quesadilla, burrito bowl.... If you like spending $7.50 on 3 puny tacos, be my guest. I suggest getting the burrito or burrito bowl. Fill them up with whatever you want: rice (2 options), beans, veggies, salsa, queso, guac, and sour cream. Still $7.50 and three times as much food as the tacos.

Fairly simple menu when you walk in. Seating is adequate.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,"Jesus Christ, if this is what people think Mexican food is, they should be handed a turd wrapped in a tortilla pooped by someone who ate nothing but good Mexican food and lots of corn.

I made the mistake of coming in here once, and my stomach is still trying to forgive me of that heinous act. People, vote with your wallets, go to South Philly were actual people of Mexican heritage reside and MAKE REAL MEXICAN FOOD. Trust me, a white dude who's failing economics didn't give a single fuck when he slapped on overcooked meat onto the over-processed flour flapjack thing and sprinkle some lettuce atop that heaping pile of diarrhea.

And the place is a disgrace on top of all the craptastic food. I've eaten in cleaner place in Tijuana. Read Mike T's review, he'll go into detail how grimy this place is and into more detail about how bad the place is [though I absolutely disagree about the absurd tasting wrapped meat concoction I was ultimately handed].

Amazing burritos in California cost $5 and are filled to the brim with deliciousness that's as hard to describe as an acid trip. Good burritos in South Philly are $7 and while not as amazing, are very good! Disgusting burritos from Qdoba cost close to $10 and are made with Hitler's own malevolent intestines and is described like an overused porta-potty. Choose wisely.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,My tacos were good but I ordered  3 cheese nachos and it didn't come with nachos after the guy suggested them to be on the side so they don't get soggy on the ride home . Talk about pissed off,QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,4,"Qdoba, the only Mexican joint within the confines of Templetown. Yeah, I know it's not REAL Mexican food, but for fast food, it'll do the trick.

The quality of food and service is pretty standard compared to other Qdoba locations. Because it's on a college campus, it gets backed up, especially between noon to 1pm (lunch) and between 7pm to 8pm (dinner). Kind of overpriced for what you get, such as for the tacos. Gumbo and burritos are more reasonably priced, which is good, because those are my go-to Qdoba items.  

The salsa selection is pretty good and flavorful. The pulled pork is my favorite meat here, it's so tender and soft and I just can't get enough of it. Everything's relatively fresh tasting, if a bit salty. Some days, the batches of food don't seem as flavorful as usual, but that's nothing a dab of hot sauce can't cure.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,"It's not the best but it's not the worst..It is pretty pricey for being on a college campus (broke students galore) but its okay once in awhile, although the price of one meal makes my wallet cry. They give hefty portions leaves you filled!",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,2,"They are SUPER STINGY with the food, barely gave any rice, any beans, any chicken. and when you ask for extra? Tries to charge you for each one. QDOBA is usually better then chipotle. Not  at this location. The food gave me. Stomach ate. It was just a little bit of food. Pay too much and go to this establishment for the crappy service and quantity and quality of the food. Eat at the Mexican food truck or go to chipotle. This QDOBA sucks !",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,"Today I went into the broad street location in north Philadelphia by temple campus. I wanted to try out the impossible meat burrito and was very excited to do so. I ordered and my friend ordered his food than we proceeded to check out. My friend got to the register and ordered a cup for a drink then mentioned our food was together. When I realized that he only had one cup I said ""wait can we get another cup?"" The cashier got upset. Then I said ""I'm sorry we wanted this food to go."" She then proceeded to snatch the food out of the bag and slam in on a tray all while saying, ""I don't have time for ignorant ass niggers today!"" At that point I'm at the drink fountain and my friend is still at the register. He says to her ""how am I ignorant if all I asked for was the food to stay?"" She proceeded to argue with him and I told him to just walk away. I then asked to speak to a manager and was denied the right. After that we still sat down and ate our food because I decided I would call corporate. Instead I stepped outside and called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. I was left on hold for about 5 minutes until someone picked up the phone. As I started to tell her they story as soon as I said she called us ""IGNORANT ASS NIGGERS"" they hung the phone up. Which then led me to email corporate. I'm saying all of this to say I have never in my life been called anything of the nature and or treated in such a manner. I will never be frequenting this establishment ever again and I hope that the lady with burgundy shirt on gets the karma she deserves. It's unprofessional and distasteful at the very least to treat people who are paying well over the amount they should be for basic bland food! I hope that this lesson out of this will be her being held accountable for her actions and in the future hiring more level headed people who aren't easily agitated with paying customers! Shame on you Qdoba! I hope this problem doesn't have to become larger than it already is!",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,4,"This is one of my go-to Qdoba locations. It's located right at broad and Cecil B Moore. I've been coming here for a while and decided to do a review. I can honestly say that service  here is always fast and friendly...today they had a line out the door of about 12-15 people before they opened and they knocked out the crowd in swift and professional manner. 

What I personally like at this location is that they take time making my quesadilla whereas some qdoba just throw the cheese on it, here they smooth out the cheese and the sauce evenly for me without me asking. The taste of my quesadilla is consistently hot and fresh, as if they literally just diced the tomatoes for the pick right before I walked in. The only thing I dislike is that sometimes they get cheese from the backside second portion near the grill and I can't see that cheese I would prefer they be consistent and get my cheese only from the cheese that's on display...I also don't like the parking here..but it's located on temple campus so the lack of parking is expected other than that..I love this place.

7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,5,"This Qdoba is awesome! The employees are alway nice, smiling, and very efficient. They always make jokes, and seem to remember customers if you go fairly often. This is my go to spot on campus if I want to grab a quick lunch.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,The food here is always so good but the workers at this location are idiots. None of them know the menu or anything that comes on the certain menu items. The stupidity of the workers truly never disappoints. I have never had a seamless experience here due to the employees.,QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,3,"Although I didn't receive the best customer service, every single employee I interacted with had great manners. What I mean by not the best customer service; I had placed an online order, so when I got there I went to the sign that said pick up here. I stood there and had to say something to them for them to let me know that I have to grab my own order from the table(which is crazy because I could've grabbed anybody's order, vice versa). But the associate handled it very well. The main reason for the 3 stars is because the store was nasty. Stuff all over the floor, and the back salad station was a mess. Everybody knows that food workstation hygiene is the first thing you cater to. As far as the food; the quality and taste was A1.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,"The staff is very, very young and immature! They are probably Temple University students which is fine. The bowl they made was very small. They should do better because Chipotle put more food in my bowl. The line was longer than it needed to be. It was very, very, very, very slow and this was at 9pm. There wasn't anyone behind me and my boyfriend. So, me and my boyfriend was together and they asked if we needed 2 bags. ‍ I don't know how DUMB these girls are. Also, 1 girl had to ask the rest of the staff to be quiet with all their talk about nothing while the line continued to stall with only 4 people in it! ‍‍ It was my FIRST AND LAST time here! I'm not coming here ever again!",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,4,"Was so happy with the portions I got from Qdoba recently. I almost never do fast-casual, but as I was hiding from the rain, I found the closest open place to wait it out was this restaurant so I headed in just to buy a drink. The smells drew me closer to the food ordering line and then from there, I decided I needed to see what the hype was about. I loaded my bowl, got chips and salsa and a drink to make it a meal. 

The bowl stayed together in the rain and through a bus ride home. I don't usually like queso or sour cream on my burritos and bowls, but this was so flavorful and made the toppings really come together. So much flavor, they packed it in- I know other similar restaurants are always so bland, I didn't know Qdoba was legit!",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,"I love Qdoba but this location could improve. Very sloppy with how they plate your food. Also food items were mixed together. White rice mixed with brown, lettuce in the corn, etc. All due to rushing and fixing your food even when their isn't a line. Portion sizes also changed. You now have to ask for double rice or they'll give you an extremely thin layer at THIS location. Have to ask for double meat because most will end up on the counter tops from them rushing. Not worth the money. Go to Chipotle or make your own bowls at home. Used to be my favorite over Chipotle.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,1,The burrito bowl is absolutely disgusting.  The chicken was lacking and dry.  The pick de gallo was missing cilantro and onions it was just tomato's and they basically just through an obscene amount of rice on there.  Never again,QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,2,"Came in during a lull in the day. Encountered one of the rudest people on staff ever. Tall slender blonde male. Was in a blue Qdoba shirt and black hat. Regarded me like I was a huge problem and actually *flung* each item I requested into my burrito bowl. Unbelievably bad attitude. I've done food service throughout my college years. That was a decade ago, but I can tell you that having someone with such a shit demeanor dealing with customers makes NO sense. I also taught public high school for several years, so needless to say I am able to let quite a lot of ridiculous Behavior roll off my back... Even consider  reasons why someone acts out.  But on a Sunday afternoon just making a burrito bowl with someone who is being completely neutral? What the hell did I do to you? If you don't like your job, find another one. Don't take it out on customers who didn't even bat an eye at you The wrong way. The other dude working wasn't so hot, either. It's pretty loud in here between the music and the hum of the kitchen, so I had a little trouble hearing some of his questions. Excuse me... The only pleasant person on staff was the young lady with pink hair. Maybe you ought to bump her up to management and fire the other two since they don't know how to treat people.",QDOBA Mexican Eats
7k9qGQyytbGxpJTnwxK6Xg,4,"Coming here was kind of nostalgic for me. I came here alot when it first opened years ago. I always get the same thing:3 cheese chicken nacho.

They lay on the rice and skimp on everything else, and it's obvious that maybe the management there gives them strict portion limits on what they can give?
