v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I was looking for a new salon in the Westchase area,  after reading the reviews I decided to stop by.   It was a Saturday and pretty busy,  so he asked me to wait for about 20 minutes.  I didn't mind, I grab some food and returned. I'm not familiar the names yet but the guy who assisted me did a very good job.  I got a gel set and it's been almost 3 weeks and no chips and it still looks pretty descent.  I'll definitely be returning.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,1,"Horrible service, had to go to another salon the next day to get my nails fixed they were so bad... person doing them took forever and didn't seem to care that they looked horrible!!!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Great gel manicures! Current one is going on over 4weeks! And they still look fresh. I'd like a few more colors but their handiwork is on point.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I have only gotten their shellac manicure so far (three times, though!) and am beyond pleased with the results. They do such a great job, don't rush, and make sure you are happy with the end product before sending you on your way. The atmosphere is relaxing, warm, and welcoming. I cannot wait to try their other nail services!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,After reading reviews and looking around I found this salon! QT was awesome! She did my nails absolutely perfect! I'm very picky and left the salon SO HAPPY with my PERFECT NAILS!  She's also so sweet and talked to me the whole time. LOVED HER! Mai and Sean were also SO accommodating! Awesome place. I found a gem!,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,This is definitely a sanctuary for extremely reasonable pricing. My bf and I tried it out soon after we relocated to the area. I've been back several times and have had the peppermint pedi and lavender pedi along with a basic manicure with clear polish (as I don't normally like getting color on my nails unless there is a special occasion ).  The pedicurists are all wonderful and friendly. I still can't believe all the service you get for the $ you spend. Thankfully I live close by and can drop by within a few minutes. I generally don't have to wait. The only wait I had was about 35 min but it was on a busy Sunday afternoon. I grabbed a quick bite across the street and came back. A+ in my book.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,4,"Very relaxing! We recommend the peppermint pedicure. 

Took my mom here for a deluxe pedicure for her birthday and it was money well spent! My mom and I are hesitant to go to nail salons because they're often not as sanitary as we'd like, but this one seemed clean enough. The staff was friendly, the environment was comfortable and overall it was a good value; about $35 per person for a pedicure including a hot stone massage, mask, towel wrap, the works. 

Room for Improvement: 
- I would've liked to see them open new packages or use new files/pumice on us. I work in the beauty industry and know that it's a standard procedure for many salons and spas now.
- While I did have an appointment for two, they started on my mom first and left me in the water for so long that it got cold. I wish they would've just had us both wait together instead. The good news is that it was still a great pedicure!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"The salon is clean. After enjoying a relaxing ""Sweet"" pedicure, I was led to the manicure table while the foot station was disinfected. The French on my toes looked very nice. All calluses were removed. I opted for the dipping powder French.

The nails are looking great! Sean did a fabulous job!! 

I highly recommend this salon. The salon is clean, Sean took his time, the end result is a very satisfied customer. 

I took a picture of my natural nails: fabulous!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I've been going here since June and I couldn't be happier with this place. My manicures and pedicures look great and last! They have a great offering of services. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Clean and soothing salon. You don't feel like a number, they are very customer focused. Also some nail salons sometimes hurt when they work around and clean your nails, not this place. Nothing ever hurts. 

Lastly try the Orange pedicure. It is the best. They rub cool limes on your feet and it feels so refreshing which is then followed by warm oil poured on an orange and rubbed on your feet and legs, followed by warm stones. Amazing!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"This is a hidden gem.  A very clean and nice nail salon.  I've found my go to place in my new neighborhood.  I've been here 5 times now and highly recommended it.  Everyone is really nice and friendly.  They have an awesome menu of different services, they play relaxing music, and even have HGTV on for those that need some inspiration.  Mai is my girl :) she is awesome!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,3,"The good: gel nail manicure lasted for 3 weeks. The nails looked very nice and grew in length. 
The bad: I went to get the gel removed. I was quoted a price of $5. The gel was removed and I was told the service was over. If you have experience in gel nails, you know that the natural nail needs to be filed and cleaned up and oil should be applied. I had to ask for the filing and no oil was offered.  With so many salons in the area, there is no reason for me to return.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Just left and I could not have received better service. The prices are reasonable and Shaun is fantastic. I will definitely be returning.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"This is the best nail salon in the area. I've gotten the gel manicure the last three times and added a sweet pedicure this time. It was fantastic!! My nails really hold up. I think this is because they take their time and do a thorough job. What a relaxing way to spend my afternoon!  I also have to add that I watched them clean up after a customer and boy, did they do a good job. I will continue to get my nails done in this relaxing shop!!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Best, long lasting manicure and pedicure  I've ever had. Everyone takes their time and does a quality job.  I went there based on Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I have worked at the sprint store in this plaza for almost 2 years and never have I been to this place. Well today I decided that I wanted to get my nails done, so took my hour break and visited this place. The lady who helped me out was so sweet and nice, we had a full on conversation made the time pass by so fast. My nails look amazing and my eyebrows are done just the way I like them. There prices are so affordable. And the place is so nice and clean and soothing. Overall I'm just in love with the place, ill be coming here now!! :)",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Linh did an amazing job on my mani and pedi. He was meticulous on my mani, I haven't had a mani like that in forever! I will definitely be back!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"If I didn't live in AZ, I would make this my go-to nail salon! My nail tech was polite, paid extra attention to detail, and her massage skills were amazing!! I highly recommend this place! So many sugar scrubs and spa pedicure packages to choose from.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I love this place. One of the best pedicures ever, so relaxing and never a ""rush job"". Try the peppermint, they make their scrubs and they are organic!

Sean is a nail genius, I love coffin shaped nails and his edges are perfect. They are always so personable when talking to you. The shop is clean and decorated simply but beautifully. 

I can't say enough good things! The owners are always there and working hard. They truly love their business! Go to Close Nails!!!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,4,"Not fancy but that's ok!  Very pleasant staff, nice job on my mani and pedi.  Will go back.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"This is the third nail salon I've tried in the Westchase area, and it is my new favorite. The techs speak English, and are easy to understand and chat with. They offer a full range of nail services, and prices are low. I'm a new regular!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"The best! Sean and Mai are perfectionists! Make a reservation, as this place is in high demand!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,My first time here as a walk in. Excellent nail salon. Staff very friendly. Salon very clean.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"The service I received was over and above what I have ever had from a walk-in nail salon. When I arrived, they offered wine and an extensive menu of specialty pedicures. I chose the coffee pedicure and it was outstanding. I received a thorough coffee scrub, masque, hot stone massage, paraffin wax dip and great polish job. I will definitely be back!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"It has been a long time since I have had a mani/pedi. Choosing a new place can be difficult but Mai made it easy. Great atmosphere with excellent service in a relaxed atmosphere.  Needless to say, it was a great mani/pedi.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,2,Raised prices of their gel manicures apparently to $30. Same products and below average manicure. I won't be coming back...,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I visited this salon yesterday based on good reviews, and they lived up to their 5 star rating. The peppermint pedicure was absolutely wonderful, my nails look wonderful down to the hand painted snowflake, and also did a brow wax to top off the visit. If you are looking for a great salon that has very reasonable prices look no further. I will definitely be going back.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,2,"Had a pretty good experience. The salon is large and clean. Staff seem friendly. Not very talkative but if you are ok with that then it's fine. Reasonable prices. $40 for SNS dip powder. They messed up the shape on one of my nails but corrected it as best as they could and it was fine, not a big deal. Will try them out again and see how I like it then.


UPDATE: Unfortuneatly I will not be going back to this salon. 4 out of 10 nails lifted after about a week. I wasn't expecting that..will be trying out another salon.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I love this place! Mai and Shawn are the best. They take their time and make sure everything is done correctly. They always make sure their customers are satisfied. I go in every 2 weeks to get an SNS manicure and redo and they are always so helpful and make me laugh all the time. There are a variety of pedicures available and the massage with the hot stone is always a great experience. The one thing I will say I was dissatisfied with was the eyebrow wax. Mai did it once and she did a good job, but I will probably only go to her for this service as a last minute option. Overall, I will continue to visit this place and get my nails done and encourage you to try it as well.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,3,"Just another average nail salon. I have a hard time finding that diamond in the rough. All I want is an above average pedi and a strong foot/calf massage. C nails is not bad just not great. Both my pedi and massage felt very average.

The facility is clean, service was good, and pricing was about right. That alone gets a five star rating, but Im all about the meat snd potatoes, give me the goods spare the fluff.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,3,"Online it says they close at 7:30, I walked in at about 6:45  thinking I'm not being rude walking in 1 minute before closing, however the time online was wrong and when I walked in they felt the need to ask me why I chose to walk in so late, I was so confused but they took me anyway. The whole time the lady was talking in a different language saying things under her breath and my pedicure and manicure were done at the same exact time while in the pedicure chair. I felt very rushed and uncomfortable, as if it's my fault the wrong closing time is posted online.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Mai and her husband are great! They really care about their customers! Best mani and pedi around!!,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"So happy I found this nail salon! The staff really makes you feel comfortable and values you as a customer. They were all friendly and offered me a drink as soon as I sat down. 

Linh did an excellent job with my pedicure and shellac manicure. He has strong attention to detail and I feel like he did above what I expected for a basic pedi. 

Their prices are very affordable. 

Will be a repeat customer for sure!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I randomly decided to stop in here because I wanted a pedicure but I didn't want to go too far because it's raining. Right off the bat when I walked in, I was seated immediately and offered a cold beverage. I was nicely given a menu of pedicure services and within just a few minutes I had my color and was started. I was thinking since it was so quick to get seated that it would be rushed through but I was wrong. 

The woman who took care of me was wonderful (I forgot her name). She took her time and really did a great job with the massage part of the pedicure, something a lot of other places skimp you on but certainly not here!!

They are very clean, friendly, and very well priced and I will certainly be back again!!!!!!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I'm in town on vacation from Boston and this shop is right next to our hotel.  Very nice, good leg and foot massage during pedicure.  They offered free drinks and are very friendly.  Several regulars came in and the staff knew them by name which shows great customer service.  I'm shocked that I'm the first reviewer, though it seems people don't Yelp as much here as we do up North. I highly recommend this place.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Best pedicure, ever. I can even get my boyfriend to come and get one with me at this place, that's a hard thing to accomplish.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Mai and Sean have become like family to me. I've been a regular for about a year now. I come in every 2 weeks to get the dipping powder on my nails and every 4 weeks for a gel polish pedicure (usually the milk & honey pedi). I highly recommend trying the powder nail polish...my nails used to be weak and paper thin until I started coming here. Can't speak highly enough about this salon!!!,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Sean is awesome - perfect nails. The skill and attention by staff exceptional. Peppermint pedi is the bomb. Stone massage, foot massage, hot towels... just fab. Clean. Make an apt.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Excellent service. Probably the best pedi I have ever had. Deluxe experience for great prices.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"One of the better manicures I've had. I only wish Shawn was still working in Orlando. He takes plenty of time with each customer and his attention to detail is worth mentioning. If I lived in the area, I would be a loyal C Nails customer!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Have been wanting to try C Nails out for some time. I walked in and was met with friendly, accommodating and warm welcome! Nice menu of pedicures and other services, so take your time choosing. Lou did my pedicure and her attention to detail was fantastic! Clean, easy to find and great prices! I'll be back for sure!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Great nail salon! They have the best pedicures and are priced well. You also get your 10th pedicure free.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,1,"I just walked in, asked for a pedicure and was told ""not right now."" I will not be going back.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I love this place so much. I've only gone here once and the place is clean and great. The only problem was the wait could be long, but I did go on a busy day so that was on me.

Everyone there was amazing and I got a manicure and pedicure at the place. 

The staff there are very kind and talkative too which makes you feel at home. Mai (the owner) really knew how to create a conversation especially when I was new there. I will definitely go back next month and become a regular. Leiu who did my pedicure was extremely nice as well. She compliments you and really gasses you up (which does make me feel like a queen). 

They all really take their time to polish with detail and the pedicure massage was insane (even though it did tickle a little bit)

Highly recommend 5/5 stars.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,4,The owner did a fantastic job on my nails! I recommend him if you want a good quality set of acrylic nails!,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,I'm so happy my nail salon is open. I needed a pedicure so bad! At C-nails they have done a great job at putting up barriers to keep everyone safe. Still a beautiful environment!,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Back again at the wonderful C Nail Salon in Oldsmar. They follow very strict health guidelines and go above and beyond for their customers. So safe, clean and ready to make you even more beautiful! The quality of their work is always exceptional and I've never been disappointed. Don't delay, you and you nails deserve it!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,1,"This was my first time coming and I went to get a dip but not even two days after I had two of my nails come off clean- no chips or bumps that caused them to fall off. My other nails are loose enough to where I feel like they might fall off soon. Not worth the $40 since I will have to get them re done less than a week after..

*same day I wrote this review I had another two fall off..",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,4,Mai fixed my super chunky fat acrylics I had gotten from a previous shop. Super friendly and retained conversation with me which is very rare. Really cared about the way my nails looked.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I'm really happy with my manicure and pedicure today.
Julie was my nail technician and she's so caring and gentle.
This place is also the best price in town... basic mani and pedi total was $30 compared to $40 everywhere else.
Great place and service!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I absolutely adore my dip french manicure.

I don't get my nails done a lot, usually opting for massages and facials instead. However, when my sister was in town she wanted to get a manicure so I tagged along and went with a dip. 

Fast forward four weeks and my nails were growing out so even though the dip manicure didn't chip (which is so amazing btw) it was time to get it redone. Research told me I had a good chance at ruining my nails if I tried to take it off myself so I decided to go to the salon and just get a manicure. (I'm guessing this is the start of a monthly maintenance routine now. This is how they get ya!)

I did a quick Yelp search and saw that this place was close and had great reviews. I called on a Saturday at about one to find out what the wait time was and they said they could see me right away.

I don't remember my nail technician's name, but it was the man, and he was fantastic. I could tell that most of the people there are regulars. The woman next to me was chatting about a gift she got her nail tech and when another woman walked in she knew the color she wanted by the number/letter combination. 

They have a ton of great dip colors. I've noticed that most places only have one or two glittery options, but they had several. As a mom, I need to insert happiness into my life when I can. I decided on a light blue with a glittery silver ring finger, when the woman next to me showed me her amazing dip french manicure. I was sold. 

It's now been almost a week and my nails still look beautiful. I absolutely adore the classic look and there is no chipping. It was $45 not including tip, because it is a little more involved than your normal dip. 

Just sign me up to be a regular here too, because I loved my experience here.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Haven't found a nail place yet since moving to the Tampa area and finally found one! Sean was such a perfectionist and he KILLED the ombré SNS of my dreams. Will definitely be coming back again and again! Everyone at this salon is so friendly and nice too,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Seriously I can't believe how amazing this place is. Must be overlooked since it only has 6 reviews. The sweet orange lime pedi was out of this world! Hot stones with oil, scrub, rubbed oranges and limes on skin, paraffin, mask, hot towels and lotion. Li-yu was great and she made sure I knew every step of what she was doing. Also gel nails were flawless. I'm from Boston but I'm wishing I lived in oldsmar just for this nail salon!!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I'm not sure if it was because I was the only person in the shop because I was the last customer or if I just had one of the most  relaxing pedicures ever. I called ahead and made sure that it was okay that I still came to the shop because it was  after 6:30 and they close at 7:30 p.m.  When I arrived the shop was empty. I felt special because all the attention was for me!

I did notice immediately but the shop was well maintained and very clean. The decor was very modern but not over the top . Immediately I was directed to choose a polish color and I must say they didn't have a lot of nice polishes to choose from. Today I was in desperate need of a pedicure and knew that I could not get all the way to my favorite shop in Clearwater. 

My technician was very polite and we had minimal conversation but he did a really good job on my pedicure. My technician took his time even though the hour was getting late. I really appreciated his dedication to do a good job even though it was time for the shop to close. That says a lot about the integrity of the shop. I chose the $25 sweet pedicure with the scented foot scrub and cooling gel  which turned out to be a really sweet treat for my feet! 

This was the first time I really noticed that this nail salon even existed. I was at the Nosh cafe next door and realized that there was a nail shop. If you decide to come to this very cute boutique nail salon definitely stop next door and get breakfast or lunch you will not be disappointed with either establishment!!!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I loved my experience here! Super clean salon, staff was so nice. I got a gel pedicure and my toes look amazing. The massage was great as well and also reasonably priced for the whole service.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"Really love this place! Everyone is very friendly, do a great job, and most of all - during this crazy time - I feel like they are taking the precautions that make customers feel safe: all staff wears masks, everyone must wear a mask, there are shields between you and the individual working on your nails, they require everyone to wash their hands upon arrival, and they sanitize equipment and furniture before/after each customer.

I have to admit it's taken me 6 months to walk into a nail salon and I almost didn't go (but my toes were a wreck and I really missed my mani/pedi time with my friends), but I felt so much better when I saw and experienced the set up!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Mai (the owner) was great. My mother in-law & I tried her place exactly 2 wks ago and my shellac mani still looks fantastic. She asked lots of questions a & really catered to all my needs from my nail tips to my toes. Thanks Mai!,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,"I just had the most amazing gel manicure from Linh. He did such a great job - he was friendly and talkative and intent on giving me the perfect polish. The salon itself is spacious and clean and offers a variety of services, including numerous types of specialty pedicures for reasonable prices. Just for reference, a gel manicure was $25, regular manicure was $12, and regular pedicure was $20. Their specialty pedicures start at $30 and go up to $65 for the fanciest one. I see other Yelpers say they were offered a drink, which I was not offered but that's OK. So excited that this place is close to home! I will be back in a few weeks!",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,1,"Just moved to the area and wanted a pedi. I walked in and asked if I could get a pedicure and she said no but maybe tomorrow. So then I said, do you know of another nail salon I could go to? And she said google....Screw off.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,4,This place is amazing. I love coming here for my stone pedicures. They have great customer service but do require you to make an appointment before showing up. Sean and his wife are the owners. They are a team and do good quality work.,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,Finding a new nail salon can be so difficult when you move but I am glad that I found Mai here at C Nails.  Her and her husband own the salon and they are awesome.  I have been a regular here for about 9 months now and always get great service from Mai. I get the No-Chip Manicure and regular pedicure and it always last me about 3 weeks which is great for my busy schedule.  Love this place!,C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,4,"My picky ass is impressed. It's not a five star experience, but I haven't liked any Pedi I've gotten in several years! Why am I impressed? Well, I got what you should expect. A pedi that lasts. It's been 10 days since I tried C Nails and my polish still looks good.

So, why not 5 stars? I splurged and got an upgraded Pedi only to hate the massage. I should've just gotten the basic because the bells and whistles of having hot stone and peppermint doesn't do a damn thing for me if the person doing the massage can't massage. I really despise the lackluster way that most nail techs do their massages. Very light, rubbing all the wrong spots and talking to their homies. I love a good foot massage but I know I won't get one in a nail salon and should've known better than to pay for the upgrade.

Oh well, I'll be back for a basic Pedi. Hopefully the next tech I get knows what they're doing. I'm quick to be turned off and have no problem with bringing down stars if service isn't consistent.",C Nails
v_vqna00z6WqKcIJZDkbAw,5,This was the first time I have been here and I have to say I am bummed I never came here before since I live so close! The variety of options is great and affordable. Shawn did my pedicure at was absolutely professional and very kind. He did a great job. I haven't had a pedi in a long time and was very overdo and he got my toenails looking beautiful. Thank you so much! I will definitely be coming back.,C Nails
