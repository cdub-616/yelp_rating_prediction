zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"If you're looking for a restaurant to bring out of town guests to, this is a good choice...Their patio is prime Tucson, and it's a resort-like gorgeous setting, which offers a perfect respite from the ordinary. On a comfortable sunny day, surrounded by a lush desert flower/humming bird/butterfly garden- be advised- you're paying a premium for these grounds. That premium was worth it to me, and I did feel recharged and renewed from enjoying the lovely patio (not so enamored about the food though). 

The food is average, but priced well above average. This is a tourist spot, and go with the knowledge that the food is priced (and flavored) accordingly. A wrap sandwich: ($12). A salmon salad: ($14.50). Prices aren't that much higher than Wildflower, but the food isn't as good either. Still, it's a nice option if you need a place to bring those out of town guests, or if you're just looking to change up your local routine. You can show off to your guests by ordering a prickly pear lemonade! 

Bonus: Make sure to stroll the grounds after you eat. They have a fantastic nursery that features native and non-native desert plants from Civano nursery, complete with helpful volunteers who will take their time explaining how to care for each of them.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"We decided to try again recently,and things are looking up. The kitchen is still very slow, and the food rather inconsistent, but on the whole it seems to be getting better. We sat outside this time, a better option with the kids and for nice weather in general, and we actually enjoyed our meal. The wait is significant in high season though, so be prepared.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"We came across this brunch place & absolutely loved it. The scenery was very peaceful & the food was presented beautifully. We got the Tres Locos Tacos, Tohono Chul Skillet, Huevos Rancheros & the Tohono Chul quesadilla with carne asada. Everything was amazing. Huevos Rancheros was a little different than what we were used to but not a bad choice. All in all very pleased with this place. Great service as well, Ryan took really great care of us!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"Great atmosphere and food was flavorful. But the older hostess was grouchy. No smile when we were greeted, when we were leaving I told her goodbye and she just stared. I can spend my money elsewhere.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"This is my favorite brunch place for sure! The prickly pear mimosa and changing menu of delicious local fare are always fabulous. I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like, honestly. The huevos rancheros over Indian fry bread was by far one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth! Can't beat ambiance when sitting outside near the garden, it's gorgeous. This place is a must.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,Great food. Try the salmon beer salad with the passion fruit iced tea at lunch. Delicious!,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"Today I came in, we ordered off of the seasonal menu and it was very good. The service on the other hand has been terrible, our server Catina took our drink order, did not deliver them, did not refill them but offered a refill with the check (she only dropped off did not pick up), she took our food order and did not deliver it other than that hasn't even been in earshot or in the general area, very ghost like. Luckily for Brett we were able to get refills and have our check and food delivered to us. So my recommendation is hire a manager to manage this place or give the busboy a serving job, I don't plan on coming back here despite the good food and beautiful location.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"The place that was here before, the tea room, was one of our favorites. We tried the new place and were sorely disappointed. The menu has been replaced with a much less interesting one. The food is pretty forgettable (not terrible). Staff is friendly and the patio is still gorgeous. Didn't hate it but won't come back. There's too many good places in Tucson to waste your time with this place.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Wonderful place for lunch, but make sure to monitor the weather.  The best place to sit and have a wonderful lunch is on the patio.  However, the patio can be too hot in the sun, or too cold in the shade, all depending on the weather.  So, pay attention and get a seat in the right place.

We were fortunate and had a great place in the shade, on a warm day.  The prickly pear cactus drinks are delicious.  I'd love to go back just for this one thing.  Service was terrific.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"My new go-to brunch place! Just around the corner from my house in Casas Adobes. Even during the summer, the garden patio dining is beautiful, but there's also an indoor seating option. I've been twice without a reservation, and didn't encounter any problems, but may be a different story during busier times of the year. Both times I ordered the eggs benedict, which has been very satisfactory. Not as good as my husband makes, but that's a tall order. One of the better renditions I've had at a restaurant. But what really earns this place 5 stars are the prickly pear mimosas. Not an original concept, per se, but they actually serve them in a wine glass instead of a champagne flute... less fancy, but more to drink! Yay! I had the same server on both visits, and he was very personable. Took the time to chat, but wasn't obnoxious or creepy. I also really appreciated that he didn't make me and girlfriends feel rushed when we were gabbing and taking our sweet time ordering and eating. Again, maybe different when they are busy and waiting to turn over a table, but it makes a big impression. Looking forward to returning again soon.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,Great food and beautiful lush desert atmosphere in this former home. Loved eating outside on patio listening to birds and soaking in the great ambience!,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"Will update because my previous review was for lunch.  Have since been here for breakfast in hopes it would be delicious, but the eggs benedict was awful.  The English muffin was badly charred and scraped but some scrapings were still on the plate and the burned taste still there.  The Hollandaise sauce had no flavor.  The fruit bowl was pretty terrible too as there were more grape stems than grapes and the citrus slices were mostly the peel. Coffee tasted instant. I complained to the server who apologized but nothing was done.  I still love the park itself and recommend it to visitors and residents alike, but the food remains a disappointment and it's doubtful we'll go back unless they change management.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,The food is seriously delicious and creative! The prickly pear lemonade is amazing and the eggs Benedict was great:) service was wonderful and Stacie the manager is so much fun! Happy Tucson is home to this beautiful gem of a restaurant!,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"After touring the park, we decided to drop by and check out the cafe. We came the day after Christmas, so it seemed like they were a bit overstaffed. The hostess asked if we'd be OK waiting a bit before being seated to give the staff time to get caught up. That was alright with us because we could check out the gift shop while we waited.

After we were seated, however, we got a weird mix-up with waiters. Will came by to take our drink orders, and a couple of minutes later Haley came by and started introducing herself and giving her spiel. We asked what happened to Will and she simply stated that ""I'll be taking care of you."" She then proceeded to take our drink orders until we pointed out that Will had already taken them. She awkwardly bowed out at that point.

Will came back about 5 minutes later with our Prickly Pear Lemonades (a novelty, a taste that's not for everyone). He took our food orders, but we ended up waiting for nearly 45 minutes before our food arrived. I had a quesadilla, which was alright. My wife had a vegetarian fry bread tostada that I considered far superior.

For the service we received and the mediocrity of the food, I consider the restaurant fairly overpriced. It is nice to taste the local cuisine, but I feel like it can be done cheaper and with less of a wait elsewhere.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"This is my new favorite brunch spot. Great food, great service, bottomless mimosas, beautiful setting. Need I say more? How about savory and sweet blue corn and green chili waffles with moist fried chicken and vanilla chiltepin syrup? Or huevos rancheros on a pillow of fry bread and perfectly seasoned smashed potatoes on the side. I'm drooling just thinking about it again. There were many more items on the menu we wanted to try. Guess we'll just have to go back. Yay!  This made my birthday weekend extra special. Thank you.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"I was suggested to stop by for breakfast or lunch by the Concierge at the Omni National Resort, and must say was very impressed by the entire experience. The actual restaurant is inside a outdoor garden, and surrounded by beautiful desert vegetation. The food was incredibly good, we had items off the breakfast menu, which we actually were too late for, but our waiter ask the cooks if they could make an exception... Which they did. 

The outdoor seating area is great, while you wait for your food you can get up and walk around on the walking paths where you can read the signs next to most the plants that describe the species. There is hummingbirds all over the place, which is a main attraction for people to visit the location. 

In summation, the location is great with a very unique and peaceful atmosphere. The service, from our one experience was outstanding,  and the food was very good and seemed very fresh. Their menu has alot of selections, with unique options, but the chefs selections are still grounded in the basics.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"A beautiful place to dine, especially in the garden. The food is very good, and maybe a bit pricey, but the biggest draw for us is the vegetarian/Vegan menu section. Breakfast was delicious and very fresh.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"The host was Friendly, the food we ordered was an upscale spin on ethnic favorites. The prickly pear margarita was the star of the show. It was beautiful to look at and to taste.
My dear one ordered the chicken and waffles. A bluecorn and green chili waffle and a crispy fried chicken breast. I was sceptical I am a purest but this was really good. The chilis had a kick to them. It was her first time having calabacitas and it was a great example of the dish.
I had the quesadilla yum a great need of flavors.
The back patio is parade adjacent
surrounded by mature trees and gorgeous blooms.
My first visit but definitely not my last.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"This place is fabulous!!! It is a cozy little place with beautiful scenery. I haven't eaten outside yet because I hate the heat (I'll do outside dining in the winter!), but the inside is adorable and very comfy-just like you went to your friends for a bite to eat. All of the food I have had was very yummy-my husband loves their eggs benedict. They have a prickly pear lemonade that I can down like there is no tomorrow. The hubby, my family, & I will be frequenting this eatery often!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"I recently moved from a suburb of NYC, where fabulous restaurants were in abundance. We have been a bit disappointed with many restaurants in Tucson. However,after having an amazing meal for lunch at Tohono Chul, I decided to bring my boyfriend for his birthday during their Thursday night music specials. Again, the food was absolutely delicious. The chile relleno is absolutely fantastic. Give this place another shot! Delicious food and a vey nice atmosphere.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"Stopped here for lunch after a playdate with the kiddos to explore the gardens. Our party consisted of 2 adults, 2 toddlers, and 1 infant. Had the restaurant been crowded, I would have understood trying to cram all of us into a single table. However, we were seated at a table in the corner next to the kitchen and next to us, sat an empty table that could have been combined with ours to give us a little more breathing room, especially with the long reach of the infant. The food was good. The prickly pear lemonade was a nice treat that everyone enjoyed, especially the two little girls, who marveled at the ""pretty pink color"". What was not so good was the price tag. 1 adult meal (sandwich/soup combo) and 2 kids meals (cheese quesadilla and mac and cheese) with tax and tip was almost $60. Service was a little spotty, but not horrible. Food delivery was prompt, but only saw the waiter once and then seemed to have a little trouble splitting our tab, took him 3 tries to get the right checks. With the prices, not a place that I can afford to eat at often, but would be a good contender for special events (Mother's Day, Easter, etc).",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"Being a big fan of the now-closed Tea Room, we decided to taste the new offerings by the Garden Bistro.  It's still the same pleasant surroundings, but we still have to wait until they open the old eating areas (still under construction) later this summer.  The staff was pleasant enough (although we badly miss the previous wait staff), but for a Wed. morning when there was only one other table being served, the service was decidedly slow.  OK, we can take that because the surroundings make a wait painless.
Now the food (breakfast).  It seems like they paid more attention to the fancy names on the menu, and much less to the food.  We both had the ""Platillo Americano"" and despite the sophisticated name we were served ordinary bacon and eggs.  They listed ""Texas Toast"" as an option and it was simply an ordinary two slices of only slightly crisp, and untoasted bread.  Please, look up how it's usually made (thick toast, buttered before sautéing and browned!  The bacon, nothing special despite its name ""brown sugar pepper mill bacon"", and the potatoes were mushy and over salted.
We realize that starting up new in a new locale is not easy, and being customers of the old ""Tea Room"" fare one can't help but compare.  It's not good, and that hurts.  We've loved the place since we discovered it after moving here, and have taken many guests here for lunch and breakfast.  Sadly, we'll wait until we see if they change with time.  At least make the food as good tasting as the pretentiously named foods.  With apologies to the Bard, ""A breakfast by any other name is still just a breakfast"".",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"The Tohono Chul grounds are beautiful and this little bistro is a perfect compliment. I was here recently for a brunch with a large group and we had a good time. The private rooms are quite nice although my only complaint is that you cannot see more of the beautiful plants, cacti etc. from inside the private room. The brunch was served buffet style and was not bad although they had few options available.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"We came here with friends, and were captivated by the food and the setting. The service was prompt, the quality of the food was outstanding, and helping you beat these views.  A small but important factor, At least to me, is the fact they got their portion sizes correct. Sometimes restaurants serve way too much at lunch. Not only was the food fresh and high-quality but the portion sizes were perfect. We had tacos and the incredible salmon salad. If you are even in this area you should go to this bistro even if you don't have time to go to the cactus garden.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"Had the prickly pear mimosas and their brunch. Everything was tasty and it's a lovely atmosphere. The service is prompt. A little pricey but it really is all about the environment. I'm sad they don't have the tea room there but this is not a bad option. It would be nice for Mother's Day. I think the chairs outside are a little uncomfortable and it can get a smidge buggy, but all in all pretty great.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,Wonderful american cuisine with good ideas. Things taste light but flavorful. There is little abuse on deep-fry and over-seasoning. All balances are just right on flavor and nutrition grounds. Atmosphere is garden like and cleanly kept. Good lighting and service as well. A must come location even with an hour driving. They also provide things with prickly pear syrup which tastes amazing,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"Beautiful location and interesting menu.  We brought friends here for Sunday Brunch before they left for Nashville, TN.  Food arrived cold, and mistakes were made with the order.  Everyone else kept mum, but I couldn't accept my plate.  Waitress didn't apologize.  Though she said nothing snooty, I  felt her displeasure with me strong enough that I lost my appetite and what I did eat soured in my stomach.  When we'd ask for more coffee, they didn't bring more cream, and by the time it arrived, the coffee was cold.  Scones were soft on top, soggy in the middle.  (Undercooked) Eggs were overcooked.  
The replacement plate was all well done, no problems, but we were so uncomfortable.  We won't be going again, as the same thing happened to my mother when she went there last summer.  Okay enough food, but servers that acted like they really didn't want to be there.  We were there about 10:15 on a Sunday morning, and not all tables were filled.  There seemed to be about 4 servers outside.  Next time, we'll go to Jerry Bob's.  Maybe the food is inexpensive, but you get service with a smile, and it's always hot.  You feel good for having gone.  Not so at Tohono Chul Garden Bistro.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"Having had an enjoyable lunch here several times, I was looking forward to joining a group of friends for breakfast. The setting is lovely. It wasn't even crowded at 8:30am on a Saturday. I ordered the Huevo Hash, with a side of pork belly,it looked interesting. The server was attentive, and the food arrived fairly quickly. Sadly, I was quickly disappointed. The poached eggs were like hard boiled eggs, and , like the other parts of the meal, tepid. The only part that was hot were the sweet potato puffs (?) because they were deep fried. The roasted corn was black bits, the baby spinach, when I searched for it, was two dark shreds. The pork belly was tasty, but really, at $4 extra, hardly worth it. The coffee- it was poor quality and way overpriced ( like $3.50?!). A few of my friends ordered the special, scones french toast, it sounded good. It was not, it was dry, leaden, clearly not soaked enough in egg batter to moisten it. They were very disappointed. 
With tax and tip, the $27 breakfast was not appreciated. A local diner type restaurant we went to the following Saturday was far superior.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"This is a must place to eat when you're there touring the Tohono Gardens which is also a must if you're going to Tucson.  It's a great place if you like cactus and succulents and gardening.  The restaurant also has a patio.  Great, great food!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Very nice place, they accommodated us on short notice. The prickly pear lemonade was sweet and tangy at the same time.. FYI they have that as a mimosa, I just didn't get to try it. Food was good, fresh. The fruits are very sweet and very fresh! Even the 8yo in our party enjoyed it. Definitely will come back when it's not 113 degrees outside.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"Sat down at the table at 1:20, it is currently 2:30 and still not served. Will give them 10 more minutes before we just walk out. If the food comes and is good I will change the rating.
Food finally arrived.  I got the chicken and waffles special. It was quite good, so I raised my rating to 3 stars.  If the service was better, the rating would be higher",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"It doesn't get any better than this!  Fast, friendly service, a quiet, natural setting, delicious food, and wonderful deserts!  I just had a perfectly prepared burger with fruit, and bourbon-pecan gelato.   Mmmmmmmm!!!!

You know I'll be back!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"Food is good, setting is wonderful.  After a relaxing walk through the gardens, this is a nice finale.
We ordered the Three Sisters Gnocchi and Chile Relleno.  While both were good, they were also overcooked.  The smokey flavored gnocchi were almost tough, and the relleno could have benefited from less time in the oven as well.  Both servings are large and filling, so you won't leave hungry.
Service is great, very friendly and attentive.  The indoor seating is modest, and if it's a cool day you would be advised to make reservations.  The outdoor setting is lovely and larger with overhanging trees and umbrellas to shelter from sun or light rain.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"This restaurant truly speaks to it's name - it's lovely sitting outside and enjoying all o the flora and fauna.  There were tons of butterfly's and grasshoppers, hummingbirds.. jus beautiful!  The service was great as well.  The waitress made sure she served me first, and made good conversation with us.  The food was more Indian - which makes sense because it is Tohono Chul.  It was different than what we were used to.  I ordered chilequiles, and it was pretty much a bowl of crunchy nachos for breakfast, instead of soft tortillas with sauce that you would think of wit traditional chilequiles.  I'm not big on nacho's andI certainly don't want them for breakfast.  My husband ordered the heuvos rancheros, and they were different too not in a good way.  It came with fry bread, instead of tortillas.  It did state this on the menu, but he really didn't like, nor the black beans that came with it.  Some of the dishes was saw coming out truly looked good, like the salmon, and the quiche.  I think if eat here for breakfast again, we'll get more traditional food, and not Mexican fare.  I would like to try the Sunday brunch sometime.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"I was thoroughly impressed, the food was delicious and beautifully prepared, we got the qusedilla and the relleno, couldn't be happier. And the lemonade is one of a kind!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"Oh the Huevos Rancheros...

A friend who has family in Tucson suggested we visit Tohono Chul during our vacation for the ambience alone. As she instructed, we went straight to the back patio. We were the first to sit outside that morning and the gardener was still watering the alluring flora. The scenery was gorgeous, but the Huevos Rancheros...

Brunch may be all the rave, but this place is perfect for a unordinary breakfast. One of our orders was the PB&J Griddle Cakes. These were three rather massive pancakes featuring peanut butter powder and topped with cactus arbor preserves, which had a distinctively mild flavor. But the Huevos Rancheros...

In case you want a more secluded meal, there are a few tables available beyond the patio out in the garden. We were not given the option to sit there, but it may have been a nice place to eat the Huevos Rancheros...

Oh the Huevos Rancheros was just the best dish consumed during our stay in Tucson. Healthy, tasty and with a Southwest flair, this was a dish to remember. The mixture of chorizo and cherry tomatoes and some sort of squash that surrounded the over-medium eggs on a piece of fry bread was an amazing combination. The home fries were equally as tasty and cooked to perfection - slightly crunchy and bursting with flavor. 

It would be nice to try some of the other things on the menu, but the Huevos Rancheros...",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"If you're thinking about ordering the ""Bottomless"" drinks, read this!!

~My biggest complain are the ""Bottomless"" Margaritas or Mimosas. They charge you $10 for the first one and then the second one is $4. Then starting on your third drink you get each one for $.01. They don't tell you this initially. I was also mad about that because we ordered our margaritas and our server disappeared until the end of our meal. He then asked if we'd like another margarita so we said yes even though it was the end of our meal and we felt full. We thought, ""What the heck, they're bottomless and we've only had one round."" No, we got charged another $8 for margaritas we didn't even finish since we had already drank the entire pitcher of water at table (because our server did not come back). 

Our bill for a salmon salad, crab cake entree, and 4 margaritas was $70 not including the tip. It did not feel like a $70 meal and we felt a bit cheated- especially seeing as how we spent almost $30 on alcohol for drinking a margarita and a half each. 

If you're going to advertise bottomless drinks, your waitstaff needs to be around to serve them!! 

As for the food itself:

Salmon salad: 7/10 
   - Salmon was flavorful and cooked perfectly
   - Overall a little too much dressing, the salad was heavy because of this. It covered the flavor of the fruit and the 
Crab cakes: 10/10 
   - Best flavor, hard to remember ever having better crab cakes even when on the coast 
   - Sides were delicious too except the beans (had no flavor) 

I wanted to love this place because of the park and the beautiful scenery, but the meal itself was lacking. That being said, if things improve I wouldn't mind coming back. It's a nice change from the usual restaurant.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Beautiful!  We had brunch outside in the fabulous fall weather.  It was a weekday morning, so it was a bit slow.  It was not a big selection on the menu, but there is definitely something for everything, with food prepared perfectly.

Four stars, rather than five, is because it is a bit on the pricey side.  Also, no one was in a hurry - Which was appropriate for our group, but might not be for everyone.  Really beautiful gardens!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,Yes this place is pricey. But where else can you have fancy lunch with good service among blooming desert flowers or sitting that close to saguaro cacti? The whole place seems to be a bungalow before and the main dining room has a colonial yet chic feel to it. Good for bridal shower or other events. Has a gift shop in one of its wings that u can browse while waiting. Food isn't bad either.,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"A lovely setting for just sitting with your prickly pear lemonade!  I enjoy the rich history of this house.  The doors that would admit horses or perhaps even a carriage.
The food.., I always find it delicious, pretty,and plentiful.  Although they no longer do a high tea in the afternoons, they gave myself and my 5 year old with her other grandma a wonderful facsimile.
It is worth the wait which does occur at times... as with any resturant.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"After a walk through the beautiful gardens, collecting ideas and taking pics, we stopped to eat breakfast.
 Wow! My daughter had the Fruit Plate, I don't even care for fruit, but this was delish.
 I had the Soft Shell Crab sandwich, which was tasty, but the flavors didn't compliment each other
 The other meal ordered was a burger, which they knocked out of the park! Moist, delicious and just right.
 The fries and sweet potato fries were excellent as well. Crispy and hot.
 The servers were sweet, and the outdoor patio was perfect.
 It is expensive, you are going to pay to sit in the greenery, but they are a little shop, in a big park, and have to earn enough to stay open, eh?
 Go in the off hours, to avoid a wait. Bring a camera.
 And throw a French fry to the handicapped sparrow, he tumbles when he walks, so they  bend the no feeding birds rule for him.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"I have been to Tohono Chul twice now and was so impressed both times! The first time I had ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the second time Chicken & Waffles. They were both delicious but I am still dreaming of the Huevos Rancheros!! 

The staff was extremely friendly both times and the overall look of the space is so beautiful which was an added bonus. 

Don't miss out on the bottomless mimosas (loved the prickly pear!) and be sure to take a stroll around the park after eating.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"This is such a lovely place for breakfast, if only the food could match the ambiance. My husband ordered eggs Benedict, but the eggs arrived severely overcooked and the potatoes cold.  I had asked for multigrain toast, but got sourdough. The waitress was super sweet and apologized for the cook who she said was ""in training"". She made everything right and was patient and good-humored, really the salvation of this experience. Oh, and I might add that the food is seriously overpriced - eggs Benedict is $13.50!  If it were exceptional, that would be one thing, but it was very mediocre. Too bad. I really want to like this place.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"The Tohono Chul Park Tearoom recently closed and the Garden Bistro opened in the same setting, complete with new chefs and management.  They were only open one week when I visited and were clearly still working out some food prep/ staffing/ order delivery issues.  The lunch menu was fairly limited, featuring a couple of salads and sandwich options or burgers.  I ordered a $10 fruit salad which was supposed to come with greek yogurt and a scone. The salad promised an array of fruits plus scone and greek yogurt but the scone was more like a small cookie, the yogurt was missing (a honey butter mixture in its place) and the salad was missing three of the promised fruits, plus it was very small, resembling your typical side of fruit decoratively placed on a plate with lemon garnish.  Definitely disappointed.  I am hoping that this was just a case of opening week difficulties and that better food and service will be coming.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,My daughter and I were looking for a non-chain restaurant in the area and I remembered this hidden gem I had gone to over 20 years ago. We were not disappointed at all and are looking forward to coming again. And to see the park too! We like to order two different plates and share the experience. Great food and drink!,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,This place is unbelievable!! Don't miss it!! Food is a WOW!! The garden setting is gorgeous and serene!! The staff is friendly a good at what they do.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"I have dined at Tohono Chul Bistro many times. This was breakfast on a beautiful day in a beautiful place in the shade with Cousine. We arrived at about 9:15 am and did not wait. She eats GF and we were both pleased that star waiter Zach had no hesitancy describing how easily selections could be modified to suit. I ordered coffee and an omelet with avocado, roasted poblano chile and chorizo with a side dish of fruit. She selected hot water (she BYO'ed her tea) and a variation of huevos rancheros with the same side dish. We were both happy with our eggs but the real feature was the fresh fruit. Lovely tasty berries (blue, rasp and straw) grapes with flavor and good texture, decent sliced (not cubed and bagged) melon, and very flavorful orange slices. Hats off to the chef there. Made a tremendous difference. The only tweak I'd suggest is the quality of the coffee, which could, I think, be ""upped"", especially for the price.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"Very hit and miss, this place. The outdoor seating area is tranquil and beautiful, which is enough of a draw to allow the establishment to get away with so-so food, disproportionately high prices and erratic service. Were I seated indoors, I'd have given a two-star rating.

I witnessed some friendly waitstaff, but our waiter was devoid of personality and exceptionally slow. My entree, the three tacos, was adequate. The brownie a la mode turned out to be three sizable brownies -- more generous than I've ever seen. Like I said, hit and miss.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"This restaurant has been in decline ever since the new owners took over. Apart from a poorly organized dining room (I was seated in a spot where every waiter brushed my chair trying to squeeze by) and a wobbly table, the kitchen is seriously mismanaged. My son and I both ordered pastries which were obviously day-old (his croissant was hard) and we had to ask three times for his scrambled eggs. Then after the waiter finally brought them, someone else tried to bring another serving five minutes later. 

The tea room used to be one of my favorite special-occasion places, but now my advice is to save your money. It's not even close to worth it.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"This bistro/cafe has great food in a unique and beautiful setting within this urban park.  Dine inside the old restored building or in the hummingbird garden and enjoy the peaceful desert ambiance.  The food matches the great setting with flavorful Southwestern dishes as well as simple but beautifully executed cafe food.  Sandwiches are the right portion and served with good french fries, the taco trio is good (although the fish taco is a bit dry - needs a good sauce), the fruit served with any dish is always fresh.  Definitely enjoy the Prickly Pear Lemonade (unlimited refills) - it's a neon pink color and everyone around you will be having it as well.  Two points of caution:  they have recently raised prices so you will pay for the surroundings and don't go hungry - the portions are fine but not plentiful.  Don't plan to split with anyone.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"The setting is absolutely gorgeous. I was not expecting to eat outside where I could see hummingbirds and butterflies, but it was a pleasant surprise. It took close to 45 minutes after ordering lunch to receive our food, which is they only reason I'm not giving 5 stars. A little overpriced for the experience, but I will definitely go back again.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"Two additional trips back to the bistro have yielded the same opinion:  mediocre food, expensively priced, long wait times, friendly staff.  

We are members of several other museums whose restaurants are operated by the same company (Pima air & space museum, Sonoran Desert Museum).  Both of these other operations are cafeteria-style, serve yourself, hot grill venues.  The food is average to good and the price is the same.  

At Tohono Chul Park, however, you have the same restauranteers attempting white table cloth fine-dining--prices and all-- whilst serving up sweet potato fries, wraps, and burgers.  Attempts at more creative entrees are dismal---either in flavor or in being pepared/presented as promised on the menu.  All in all, it simply does not add up.  

As much as we loved eating brunch after a stroll through the park, we will not be returning until there is a change in management.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"What a lovely setting! We truly enjoyed our meal here , it could have been fantastic had our waiter been slightly interested in creating a better experience.  The menu is great with food specific to the region and different from any place else! We were compelled by a sign in front of the Bistro stating bottomless mimosas and margaritas. However when we asked for a refill he laughed and said no. This seemed odd since it was what brought us in in the first place. When we asked questions regarding the menu his answers were non informative and completely unhelpful. He seemed uninterested in helping us at all. We were thankful that the meals were so very tasty and the atmosphere completely serene.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"We visited for brunch after our hike and the only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the breathtaking atmosphere. Otherwise, it would have been a 2 or 3. The service wasn't great. Our beverages were not refreshed timely at all. At one point one of the diners from our group got up and went to the service area to refill her own coffee after waiting too long. The food wasn't bad but not the best I've had. If it weren't for the atmosphere, I wouldn't return because the price is too high for just okay food and mediocre service. One of the hostesses had poorly fitting clothing. Pants far too tight with a short shirt creating a slight ""spillage"" at the midriff. Not what I expected at a place like this. Also, the ladies room was in need of repair. One of the toilets wasn't secured to the floor properly and it was extremely wobbly.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,Great ambiance. Even if the food was bad (which it is not) the scenic ambiance is well worth the experience. Sunday brunch is my favorite. Bottomless drinks and delectable cuisine.,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"The atmosphere is very nice as long as not too hot.  Most of the indoor employees were weird.  They all could care less.  My husband had to remind me several times they are all volunteers.  I don't think that is any kind of excuse.   Once past reception for the restaurant it got better.  The manager was very nice he sat us immediately and turned us over to another very capable waiter.  We had mimosas which were nice but too much sugar, I had the Chile rejellno which was huge but I didn't really like it.  Not enough protein inside.  It was stuffed with cheese and chicken but I was like where is the chicken?  I never found it.  The batter was tasteless, too much of it and doughy.  I do know how they should be.  I was forced to make these with my mother  I would never order that again but I would go back and try something else.  My husband was happy with his tacos.  He would also go back.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,If it's not broke don't fix it.  We went to the Tea Room on average once or twice a month for the last 20 plus years and there were some ups and downs but all forgivable because the Tearoom itself was charming.  PAST tense.  The charm is no longer there and even the old Mexican tile floor has been cemented over which was part of the history and atmosphere.  I could go on and on but now it's just a very ordinary restaurant with a silly new name out of the 1980s.   Haven't attempted breakfast yet but the new lunch menu is overpriced for what you get.   Even if we hadn't been big fans of the Tea Room this new Garden Bistro is not where we'll take visitors.,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"We came here with a party of 8 early on a Friday morning for a pre-wedding brunch. Most of the group had already put their drink orders in when I arrived, and nearly everyone was doing the mimosa deal (first is $10, second is $4, and subsequent are free) but I ordered a Bloody Mary. The waiter didn't write down my order and ended up bringing me a mimosa, so that was a bit annoying, but they were good so I just drank it instead of throwing a fit. The service was fairly attentive and the food was good, but I could sense a bit of annoyance with us as we stayed after eating our food to have a few more mimosas - after all, that was the deal. I might come here again, but probably not in a big party.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"Went for mothers day and had a reservation. We were sat right away and we sat on the back patio. My mom thought it got hot in the center of the restaurant so she wanted to be out back on this awesome day. We sat for about 20 minutes before my mom had to go and get someone to serve us. When we finally got a sever, she was friendly but it was obvious she did not know what she was doing. Very little ""service"".  Came over to see how we were doing but never cleared any plates away so we sat there with all of our dirty plates. Food was mediocre at best. When we were walking up to the buffet the manager (bigger guy), was over heard telling his staff he only had to deal with one customer and his ""ridiculous"" complaints. Just thought this was very unprofessional and should have been saved for the back kitchen. We get our food and sit down. I had what appeared to be grilled corn. It tasted like cleaning chemicals and was absolutely gross. The back patio smelled really bad and as I drove out I realized that the loading dock and trash are adjacent to the patio, explained the horrible smell. Nothing like eating next to trash baking in the hot Arizona sun. On the way out it smelled like cleaning supplies as as well. Hence maybe the taste in the food. Over all spent 170 dollars for junk food and service. Go elsewhere...",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"What an excellent little find on the Northwest side of Tucson! The real reason to go here is to sit on their patio within the gardens. We came for brunch and I enjoyed my Eggs Benedict. It wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst I have had. The service is what a lot of people have remarked on. Ours wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. So this is all to say that everything except the beautiful patio I sat in was just alright.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"By all means, go to the park, but if you care about the food experience, I'd suggest eating elsewhere. A friend and I had lunch there yesterday.  It was pretty, and we were hoping for an all-around good experience. The Nutella crepes were very strange...possibly because the Nutella is blended with cream cheese, and although it was edible (although we didn't eat much of it), it was just...off. If I'd never had it, I would have been ok with that. In the future, I'll stick to Nutella ""straight up"", thank you. My friend had the eggs Benedict which were, again, adequate but nothing to write home about. They were accompanied by ""grilled English bread"" that looked like it had been marinated in oil. ugh  I had the tres tacos. They were very bland, and the steak was so chewy I didn't even bother with most of it. The items are not INexpensive (the taco plate was $15.50) and although not out of reach either, I would rather have spent that money on admission to the park and had a tasty lunch somewhere else.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

My sister & I both had the street tacos. What a disappointment! First, there was nothing remotely fresh on this plate. The ""calabacitas"" was a small dish of tasteless brown mushy, overly cooked squash & onions. The chicken taco was dry & overly salted, the ""carne asada""  taco was tasteless, mushy brown mystery meat. The best thing on the plate and the only thing eaten was the cod fish taco, which was just an okay piece of frozen breaded fish. If you are going to charge over $5 per taco you really should step it up.

We must've driven by this place a hundred times and only decided to come to the garden to entertain our out-of-town guests, but now wish we had discovered it earlier! Definitely plan to visit the gardens after lunch/brunch which is the main plus of coming here to eat-- the gardens are beautifully decorated. 

They serve breakfast and lunch daily (no dinner service), as well as Sunday brunch.

The bistro itself is pretty good, do expect a wait. The four of us waited 25 minutes for a table for Sunday brunch, which was okay because there is one crafts gift shop and one greenhouse plant shop on site that have neat things.  After ordering, it was about another 35-ish minutes to get our food. They have a ton of outdoor seating with nice earthy, relaxing ambience. The place is also decorated with beautiful paintings by local artists that you can purchase.

The omelets are huge and really good. You choose 3 toppings for $13, $1 for any extra toppings. They come with a side of potatoes, toast and jam.

Fast forward to the Bistro. My once loved meal is no longer, so we tried others. For breakfast, I had the avocado toast. Absolutely no flavor. Hugely disappointed. I recommend First Watch for the best avocado toast. I can't remember the meals I got for lunches. Not one was memorable or delicious. Just very disappointing after so many years of enjoyment.

We dined for breakfast on a not too warm Tuesday in August, early morn, surrounded by all matter of cacti, vines, and green things.

 Our server was kind, friendly, warm, and knowledgeable. We chose to sit outdoors on the back patio..only two other couples there. Shady, with tiny bits of sunshine peeking thru, quiet, and decently private for some good one on one conversation.

I had the delectable Huevos Rancheros. Came with two eggs (get over easy), Native Fry bread (crunchy, warm, puffy, chewy), Calabacitas, Ranchero & Tomatillo sauces, and most notably, their handmade Chul Sausage. Wow! Just wow. Haven't had such magificent Huevos Rancheros since our stay at the Four Seasons Scottsdale. This chef made this food with passion, and I will remember every taste! 

If I had nowhere else to go, and could luxuriate all day, I would partake of the splendid bottomless Prickly Pear Mimosas...of which, sadly, I had just one.

Hubs got the PB & J Griddlecakes with homemade Cactus Arbol Preserves (OMG! nectar of the gods) Peanut Butter Powder(Just trust the process)Bananas Royal, Chul Sausage. He was delighted with the artistry of it all.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"Stopped in for lunch (April 2013) after visiting the park, and was met by friendly staff who were obviously working very hard to seat guests promptly and accommodate their wishes for indoor/outdoor seating. I sat inside at a table with a lovely view of the outdoors (flowers everywhere) and with the assistance of my very helpful server, Angellina, decided on a quesadilla that was light, crispy, flavorful and delicious. 

After discussing dessert options with both Angellina and Jessie, I tried the chocolate mousse which includes a vanilla bean concoction that is just wonderful. I found the coffee to be quite strong, and was quickly provided with a small pot of hot water that reduced the strength by just the right amount. Speaking of beverages, the prickly pear lemonade was most refreshing on this warm afternoon. Angellina visited my table periodically to make sure things were OK, and Jessie also stopped by more than once to make sure I had enough water, after bringing a glass shortly after I was seated.

All staff members I observed were very pleasant while at the same time very busy, and I admired how they all worked together to keep things running smoothly on a busy Saturday afternoon.

I ordered the quiche and side salad with a delicious balsamic dressing and my husband ordered the three soft tacos- one with fish, pork and chicken. We enjoyed the meal and ordered the warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream which was very good. The prices are a little high but well worth the whole experience.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"The Tohono Chul ""Garden Bistro"" is redeemed largely by the atmosphere of its patio. While the old Tea Room was fairly uneven over the years, its last chef was talented and capable enough to create food that enhanced the experience of sitting in a beautiful garden. The Garden Bistro fails to achieve this--at least their lunch menu does--offering bland, overpriced fare that is little more than an excuse to sit outside. The mushroom and vegetable open-faced sandwich proved to be soulless and poorly integrated, though the small basket of sweet potato fries were well tasty and perfectly cooked. The quiche special was forgettable before it was even swallowed, but was sufficiently filling.

The server was attentive and helpful as we looked over the brunch menu and made our decision. My mother and I decided to split the dos rancheros that came with two eggs, native fry bread, potatoes, calabacitas, ranchero and tomatillo sauces, and ham. The split charge was $4.00 but well worth it to receive a smaller yet still very filling portion. 

The presentation reminds of an open face sandwich with the fry bread on the bottom, sauce, and fried egg on top. Accompanied by the calabacitas and potatoes and either corner. Both were well cooked and well seasoned. The sauces added another layer of flavor as well. 

Overall our experience was very good and worth a stop before or after you stroll the gardens.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"The food here is not interesting or innovative, but very unoriginal and bland. I definitely thought it was overpriced (seriously who charges 6.50 for coffee that you made in a pot and burnt). Brunch at prep and pastry is infinitely better, and much less expensive. There are no good alternative options for people who have dairy or gluten restrictions. Skip it and save a lot of money. The most overhyped spot in Tucson. This was one of the most disapointing fifty dollars I've spent(for two people) and we didn't even get booze.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,We have eaten here many times and the service is always wonderful! The food is also very good and we enjoyed birds and butterflies flying around our table while we ate outside in the garden,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"Just excellent! If you're lucky enough to come on a day when beef stew is one of the soups, grab it. The Palmer is a great beverage, and everything including the gift shop is high quality.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"After a stroll through Tohono Chul, we stopped in to sit and enjoy the nice weather and some bloody marys.  Bloody marys were good, not as spicy as we would have hoped and asked for...but good.  Our server Trevor was friendly and attentive.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"It wasn't a great morning and neither my wife nor I was in the best of moods.  So, I offered to take her to lunch in hopes it would cheer us both up.  She had been to the Garden Bistro at Tohono Chul for lunch with some former work colleagues and liked it, so I decided to make the long drive across town.

The last time I visited the Garden Bistro at Tohono Chul Park was probably about 30 years ago when it was a Tea Room.   If memory serves me correctly, at that time it was just a small handful of tables inside the Gift Shop serving tea and artsy little sandwiches.  Boy, what a difference a couple of decades have made!

Inside seating is by windows looking out over the patio dining area and the Park's gardens.  We were offered our choice of inside seating or on the patio.  We opted for inside and were seated promptly.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive while, at the same time, totally invisible.  His timing was impeccable.

We both chose the Blue Corn Sopes with Carne Asada.  The sopes were accompanied by Cholla Corn Slaw, Calabacitas, Red Chile Sauce, Asadero cheese, and Pico de Gallo.  The delicious blue corn masa patties for the sopes were perched atop a large portion of the Cholla corn slaw, which featured fresh off the cob corn, red and green bell peppers, onions, and very mild but flavorful thin strips of chile peppers.  It was visually appealing and tasted great.  The calabacitas consisted of diced zucchini with corn and black beams.  Not at all what I was expecting, but delicious none the less.

But, the star of the dish was definitely the Carne Asada.  Melt in your mouth tender strips of beef that were seasoned and charred to perfection.  Probably the best carne asada I've ever tasted . . . and I've tasted a lot.

You can bet that I won't wait another 30 years before I go back.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"Mixed feelings about TC. Love the food and eating outside in the garden. Three stars because 1) their meals are large and they charge a split plate fee.  So I can pay, overeat or take a box (not great in the Tucson heat). They should reconsider the split plate fee...show some respect for small diners.  2) they run their suggested tip on the bill based on the total which includes tax. Not cool CH!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"The food is relatively good here except for an occasional stale bowl of lettuce or bread.   However the last lunch visit I had with 2 friends wasn't the greatest service when it came to asking for ONE refill of iced tea.  It wasn't like we were hanging around holding up a table - I had asked for a refill when the waitperson brought our meals and I stated ""no rush"".  It never showed.   The person that took our order didn't have much of a service type personality either.   It was like it pained him to be there.  Possibly it was an off day, we all have them, but a bit more engaging would have been nice.   Wait staff should realize it affects the tip.  After all the food is a bit overpriced for the quality. With all the winter visitors we've had this year the management should keep abreast of what type of service patrons receive.   Otherwise the garden was beautiful !!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"I've been here for their Friday happy hours and also brunch. Although I've always had amazing service, the food here is just not that impressive. The small dishes offered during happy hour were cold and didn't seem freshly made. I can't even remember what I got for brunch because it just really wasn't that memorable. The prickly pear drink was very delicious though.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Tohono Chul is home to a botanical garden, art museum, bistro, and gift shop. You can easily spend up to an entire day wandering around here. There is an admission fee for the garden and museum, but the Garden Bistro does not have an admission fee and is a lovely spot to dine at and to also get a glimpse of the garden. The bistro is open daily from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., and the food aims to be locally sourced and organic. Parking is free. 

I had lunch with a friend, and I ordered the chicken and waffles. The portion was hearty and left me too full for dessert. The chicken was tender, and the waffles had a nice little kick to them. The entire plate was flavorful, especially the Tajin watermelon. It was a lovely summer day so we dined out on the patio and enjoyed the scenery. The service was a little slow considering that the place was almost empty, but that was fine with me since it gave me more time to soak in the scenery. Overall, the Garden Bistro is a great lunch spot due to the food and ambiance. Take your time, and you will be in for a very relaxing and comforting meal.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

Aside from the fact that the many acres of beautiful local and not so local plants in bloom and the beauty of being in such a place, the lunch spread and the service were excellent.   We had a private room for all the extended family and friends and they provided everything we asked for from the mini chocolate cakes that were grandpas favorites to the quietly lovely music that filled the background.  It was an elegant and tasteful event thanks to the folks at tohono chule that helped us put this together.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

Just overpriced I think.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Probably our favorite brunch place since moving to Tucson. From the lush gardens and wildlife to the awesome service and food... bottomless mimosas are merely a bonus at Tohono Chul.  My only criticism is... on Fridays they offer happy hour from 4 till 8. We imagined mixing out in the garden and talking to the chef over canapes .. that is not what it is...it was more like your typical restaurant experience- people seated tables apart ordering from a prix fixe dinner menu (which pales.in comparison to their brunch menu) um overall, the food and drinks are still good but it wasn't the intimate, chef drive experience we were expecting.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"I have been to Tohono Chul, with my wife, about 10 times. First time about 1.5 years ago. The food was good (not spectacular), but good. My favorite was the Huevos Rancheros, although even with that I received it once cold. My wife has tried almost everything and most of it is not bad, but not great either. We go back because we can sit outside in the garden and watch the hummingbirds and we can bring our Jack Russell. The food has declined with each visit. 
We went back yesterday for breakfast and they changed the menu, trashing the best breakfast dish they had, Huevos Rancheros, replacing it with ""dos rancheros"", which is basically huevos rancheros less the potatoes and more-- for a higher price! 
Whomever is responsible for the restaurant is not doing a hell of a good job.
Severely disappointed.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"I am back to Tucson and was looking forward to introducing this place to a friend. I have to say that the food was a huge disappointment. We both had the smoked salmon salad and the salmon seemed like it came from a can and definitely not fresh. I love salmon and the color was so pale pink that it was almost unrecognizable as salmon (even for pink salmon) The greens were fresh but the amount of vinegar in the salad kind of ruined  that. The dressing served on the side was the best thing about the dish, but only a small portion was served. I was looking forward to a nice smoked coho and for the price of $16.50 I was applauded at the quality of the dish. The service was ok, but I was served the wrong tea. I used to frequent the place when it was the ""Tea Room"" and it was usually packed this time of year with all the winter visitors and locals alike. I wondered why it was so empty at 12:00 noon and now I think know why. I talked up how lovely the grounds were and the food, although catered in, was fabulous. Not the case this visit.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"food was better than I would have thought reading the reviews - so the change in owner/menu/whatever has been successful.  my Mom got their hatch green chili relleno special. stuffed with chicken, black beans, cheese, etc.  it was the size of a small loaf of bread and was delicious!  I had their skillet which was tasty.  and friends got the breakfast with fry bread.  it was different than fry bread you get at the fair (so probably healthier!) so that was a little different than what we were expecting, but mixed with churizo and eggs it was a really tasty dish.

the tables are almost too close together in the main dining room.  we felt a little crowded and the waiters were having to constantly move around tables because they couldn't get through certain paths if all chairs were occupied.

Our server, Joseph, was very friendly and fun.  It felt like the poor guy had the entire dining room in his area.  so he was definitely hustling but we always felt well taken care of.

next time I will go when it's warmer to try some of their lovely patio seating.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Update! Tried Tohono Chul again and was very impressed with the chicken and waffles and our server. We sat on the patio and enjoyed great food and service. Our server was friendly, attentive, and patient. The food was fresh and delicious. Highly recommend the chicken and waffles. Beautiful setting but you are in a garden so.......Complaints-The bees were swarming, which made eating a challenge and the female hostess at the front with long dark hair was absolutely rude and unprofessional. She had her arms crossed when speaking to me and made it very clear that we had to sit outside. She wasn't friendly about it which made me wonder why she felt the need to be rude. No smile, just matter of fact with an attitude. With that said, I will return but will probably eat inside! I also highly recommend reservations to avoid the attitude. It gets very busy.

Returned for a friends birthday lunch. We ordered sandwiches. It took almost an hour to get these club style sandwiches. I ordered ice tea from 2 different people and it finally showed up. We asked where the food was and was told 'it was busy'. Excuses and no apology. Two stars for edible but def not delicious",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Tohona Chul has a special place in my heart. The park was my father's favorite place, and we actually dedicated a bench to my parents there after they passed away (it's the one right across from the sundial. IYKYK). The bistro is the kind of place we always take visitors to, because there's something on the menu that appeals to everyone, from burgers to salads, chicken and waffles, and all kinds of breakfast fare. Two of our diners are very picky eaters with dietary restrictions, and both of them cleaned their plates. We've never brought anyone there who didn't enjoy their meal. 

Get there a little early, get a beeper and go into the gift shop and wander around until they call you. Support a great Tucson treasure! And don't forget to take a leisurely stroll around the park while you're there!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro

The food options are unique. Everything is so fresh.

The prickly pear lemonade is a must, very refreshing. The food was also very good and had a good variety.

I had the prickly pear margarita which was one of the best margaritas I've had in Tucson. They offer a bottomless mimosa and margarita deal for $14. A single is $10. If I wasn't driving, I would have definitely taken advantage of this deal!

I ordered the eggs Benedict with potatoes. The potatoes were nice and crispy and the Benedict was delicious. It was served over crusty white bread with ham and three poached eggs.

One of the women got sick and began vomiting so they requested the food that they ordered be boxed up before it came out of the kitchen, to which they were upset about when thats how it came out, because some of them decided to stay and eat there after all, with no concern to their sick friend... or letting the server know they changed their mind. Guess mind reading is a part of serving, never knew! It was hard to enjoy the beautiful garden being seated next to a couple ""Karens""  who seemed determined to have a negative experience.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"My wife and I are members of the Tohono Chul gardens.  It is a beautiful setting for a restaurant.  We were there with our two grandchildren age 10 and 7.  We were seated in a far corner of the outside area of the restaurant.  This made it difficult for the server to take care of us.  It took a long time for him to take our order.  We had the taco entree, the sopas, and the vegan sausage sandwich.  It took a long time for the food to arrive which I thought was due to the restaurant being busy initially.   The food arrived cooler than I thought it should be likely due to sitting.   My vegan sandwich was $16.50 and was a vegan sausage that are sold for 4 for 5 dollars.   The kaiser roll and pepper mixture could not cost more than a couple of dollars.  My wife got the sopas.  They were very greasy and cool again.  I consider myself a foodie and feel the chef here does not understand seasoning.   The menu items read innovative but the execution is being done by an amateur chef.  My grandkids did not eat the food saying it did not taste good.  The bill was almost 70 dollars.  I am positive a first rate chef could fix all of these issues.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"Our party of 4 arrived yesterday at 12:03 p.m. A sign was posted to wait to be seated. While it wasn't busy, it took 10 minutes for someone to come to seat us. We requested the patio under a heater lamp but were seated far from the nearest lamp. The 2 daughters returned to their vehicles to get additional clothing to wrap up in for our mothers. It took quite some time for our order to be placed. Minutes afterward one of the mothers, the 90 year old, the 1 in the wheel chair, started to vomit. She and her daughter left immediately asking the waiter to hold the order if it had not yet been put in. he informed her that the order had already been placed and she instructed him to wrap their order to go and give it to me to bring home for her and her mother.  During our rather long wait not one person refilled our beverages or checked with us. When lunch was delivered to the table everything was wrapped to go. I was rather annoyed and informed them that my mother and I were staying to eat. They retrieved 2 plates and proceeded to dump our lunches on to a plate leaving our table trashed. There were boxes and bags, partial lunch portions, open Brown box carry out containers,  And cold cups of tea and coffee left on the table. The waiter disappeared knowing I was completely disgusted by the appearance of our brunch and the lack of responsibility from the waiter. Not once did he asked if he could refill my coffee bring my mother more hot water or  Clear the table so that we could be without all the boxes all over the place. Because he was annoyed he retrieved the manager  Who was also unapologetic. The bread that came with my salad was dumped into the Box with my lunch and was wet. I asked for it to be replaced.  I was charged extra for the bread. My mother's bread was also wet and disgusted and dumped onto her plate. Her croissant sandwich was void of anything except a lump of chicken salad. The staff were put out by our request for hot coffee and tea. The carry out meals were unappealing.  In addition, they claimed to be handicap accessible. While this is somewhat true, it isn't easy. In order to get a wheel chair in they have to go retrieve a ramp and put it over the steps. We were using a small compact wheel chair that barely fit through the door. When leaving urgently my friend had to stand in the doorway while her mother was throwing up waiting for them to get a ramp to put on the door jam so they could exit.  What a colossal waste of time and money. It wouldn't even be about the money if they had been somewhat  accommodating. The fact that we were treated abruptly and rudely left such a badd taste in my mouth that it was impossible to evaluate the food.

zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"My husband is always on the lookout for restaurants serving organic food. We were delighted to find out the Bistro at the Tohono Chul Gardens features organic food on their menu. Once we saw on our first visit that you can sit outside in the beautiful gardens, we were hooked. We always go for their brunch on the weekends, and have yet to be disappointed.

It is a great place to take out of town visitors, as it is a great showcase for the beauty of the Sonoran Desert. We usually arrive at the bistro no later than 10 or 10:30 on the weekends, and we have never had to wait more than 15 to 20 min for a table. I have heard the later you go, the longer your wait might be. We also often choose the bistro on rainy weekend days, as that can limit the crowd (a portion of their patio seating is covered, so you can eat outside despite the drizzle).

We usually sit outside. While sitting inside is fine, being outside gives the full garden experience. I always take advantage of their bottomless prickly pear mimosa/margarita special. I usually stick with the mimosas, even though I am a huge tequila fan--the champaign/prickly pear mix is perfect for breakfast. They also have several non-alcoholic options. My husband doesn't usually drink alcohol, so he'll usually order a Pellegrino with a splash of their prickly pear mix in it.

Their menu is fairly varied for its smallish size. Another reason we are fans of the Bistro is because the menu has vegan options for me and gluten-free options for my husband. I typically get either the avocado toast or the graze lunch bowl. My husband loves the chile relleno and the grilled shrimp street tacos. Their smashed spuds are so good my husband always get an extra side, regardless of the entree he chooses.

The servers are kind and prompt. Even though it is always busy when we go there I never feel like we are waiting long for anything.

I noted some other reviews have complained about price. I expect to pay more for organic food. I also assume some of the income goes to support the gardens as a whole. I am happy to put a little extra towards the bottom line for the beauty the gardens provide. The gardens are half the reason to go eat there in the first place.

If you haven't been, check the bistro out!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"Truly over rated and expensive. Was very excited to try this place. The grounds are beautiful and if that is all you want than this is the place for you but if you want it paired with great food, good service at a great price than try somewhere else. The food is mediocre. I gave it two stars instead of one because if you drink it would be an amazing place to a drink and sit in a beautiful garden. I don't drink.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"The food is absolutely wonderful but i mostly come for that prickly pear juice and the wonderful scenery. The art they have up around the place for sale is gorgeous and so unique. They have a gift shop that sells more art and desert theme kitchen items, rugs, shirts, jams and more. The wait staff is always so polite and friendly. Service is very comfortable. Worth bringing your family, friends or even going on a date.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"This is one of my favorite places.  The food is good, but more than that it is just a lovely setting.  The patio is gorgeous, and the inside seating is eclectic and quaint.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"Come for the garden atmosphere, not the food. I paid over thirty dollars and it was disgusting slop out of a can. It wasn't chicken either, it turned out to be pork. Either way, it was gross and very expensive. Not impressed and won't be back!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"The spot was serene & peaceful ; a beautiful oasis in the Sonoran desert.
During the middle of hot summer day the temperature hovering over 100 degrees, the outdoor garden patio where we were seated felt breezy under the shade of tall trees & bushes . The birds were singing & flowers were everywhere. The service was great , the food was okay if not superb, & the wait time was long. But it was totally worth the visit.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"I love this place and was excited to take girlfriends visiting here for brunch. Good thing it was beautiful since we got such horrible service. Took over an hour for food to arrive. While we were told it was late due to just coming out of the oven, both arrived cold. No apologies until after five asks about our food. All tables around us came after, ate and left before we got our food. Was disappointed as use to love coming here.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"This is a beautiful place! The gardens are amazing, there is lots of outdoor seating and the service is excellent. After the waiter told me about the Monsoon Salmon Salad, I selected that and the bottomless Prickly Pear Margarita. The food and drinks were exceptional! I will definitely be back!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"The Hamburger was great! Top quality meat! The service was great, I loved having lunch in the patio. The only problem was that I had to keep swatting flies way from my plate. If they could find a way to resolve that I would be there every weekend. Thank you I loved your restaurant!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"Go to Tohono Chul for the docent tours of the garden. We were advised by locals that this is a great bistro, but that wasn't our experience. We arrived early enough that we didn't have much of a wait and the seating outside is lovely. We were served pretty quickly as well. They offer a good deal on bottomless beverages (we didn't partake) and on sharing an entree. The entrees all looked big enough to share and for $5 they'll split your order and give you an extra side. So far, so good. We decided to try the tacos. If you split that order, instead of three, you get four tacos. Sounds great! We tried the fish, chicken, and beef. The fish taco was delicious. The chicken was cold. The beef was chewy. After the food was delivered, our server did not return. We ended up having to go to the hostess station to pay our bill.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"This is probably one of the best meals I've had in a while. The food was super delicious, had a lot of flavor, and the portion sizes were very large which was great. The prickly pear margaritas are also something you have to try when you come here because they are amazing. I ordered the Graze Lunch Bowl which is vegan and comes with spinach, vegan sausage, crispy potatoes, garlic aioli, tomatoes, etc. this is one of my favorite spots to eat at in Tucson because of their delicious food and because of their prickly pear margaritas. The other people in my party ordered avocado toast, ricotta toast, and the breakfast charcuterie. All of these plates were very large portions and everyone loved their food.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"Delish brunch place! I had tacos, eggs and smoked salmon. All very tasty. The location is known for humming birds. But, sadly the day I was there was very cold. So no hummingbird sitings. The restaurant also has a tremendous gift shop. Many local wears from Tucson artists if you are looking for a unique souvenir. I believe there is a museum and another gift shop along with walking trails. We went early just for breakfast. But, would love to return to explore the property.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"Just visited Tohono Chul Garden Bistro for lunch yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Sitting on the patio in the (finally!) cool fall weather was lovely. It was nice to be surrounded by the lush garden as I ate. The squash soup was yummy (I love that the squash was grown on site) but a little sweet for my taste. The chicken club panini was so good! I've been disappointed by similar sandwiches at other restaurants, but this one was perfect! The focaccia was crisp and flavorful. The avocados were bright green and creamy, not like some of the hard or brown avocados that I've been served elsewhere. You can't beat the fries at Garden Bistro either--delish!

Overall, it was a fabulous lunch and a great place to enjoy the beautiful weather while satisfying your appetite. Will be back for sure!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,Try the chicken and waffles! They're such a unique take on the dish and truly worth it. The service and scenery are wonderful.,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"After touring the gardens we decided to eat a late lunch. We ordered the chicken tacos & shrimp tacos, each of which came with 3 tacos and a side of beans. My date enjoyed the chicken tacos,  although there was so much sauce in a single taco that it literally covered and dripped down his hand. The shrimp on my tacos was tasty, however the flavor was drowned out by a salad dressing-like sauce that inundated the shrimp and the spinach and cabbage in the taco. It was really not good. Also not good was that the tortillas were cold, as was the grated cheese. I ate the shrimp,  tried to scrape the dressing off the vegetables. I let the server know, and the consolation prize was a scone. Ah well.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"We have been huge supporters of locally owned restaurant during the time of Covid. We want them to make it through this very difficult business climate. 

Unfortunately we just had the rudest experience in over a year. We have eaten at the Garden Bistro at Tohono Chul Park many times since 1998. Love the park, have always enjoyed the food and prickly pear margaritas after touring the gardens.

Their website states last seating at 3:30: however,  a chalkboard as one approaches the hostess stand says lasting seating 3:00. A quick glance at my phone shows we are just within the lime frame. Except, the hostess is chatting on the phone and refuses to make eye contact. On the dot of three o'clock she hangs up and says, ""I can't seat you now."" Other parties are having the same experience. One lady asks to speak to a manager. The manager seats this lady and indicates she will be back to seat the rest of us. Ten minutes later staff is constantly walking around us and completely ignoring our presence. We are extremely disappointed to end our visit this way but obviously the management and staff have no interest in our business. Perhaps the next time we're in Tucson there will be new owners/management and quality service will be restored at the Garden Bistro.

Covid not only makes difficulties for restaurants but being visitors trying to support the travel industry is also not easy. My advice stay home and save your money until businesses get a clue. It's been a year, how long do you think it will take?",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,I have grown up visiting Tohono Chul.  I had a big brunch there with some friends the other day. My meal was delicious and so was my prickly pear margarita.  It is very pretty here.  The only reason I marked it down was that I thought the menu prices were pretty high for brunch in Tucson.  I definitely would go to this place for special occasions.,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"We spent the dkmay at Tohono Chul Gardens. The entire place is beautiful and we take a lot of pleasure discovering new cactus and plants. A nice brunch was just what we needed. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and my husband ordered the Loraine omelette. Both were delicious. I have to say that the side of beans with my quesadilla were some of the best I have ever eaten. A carafe of chilled water is placed on the table when you are seated, thank you! Also had a Bloody Mary, hot and spicy just the way I like it. Wonderful experience and fantastic meal.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,"The simple review: the grounds, layout, and ambiance are beautiful. The food is mediocre. The concepts are original and the flavors are good, but they don't know how to cook eggs. Their brunch cocktails were disappointing. The worst part is that the service sucks. The host was condescending. We waited over 10 min to be be greeted. And since the service sucked, we ate over cooked eggs (couldn't wait any longer). Oh, and it's overpriced. Not coming back for a while.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Wow! This place is a hidden gem. My friend and I dined here last weekend and I wish I had known about it sooner! 

First, the setting. It's absolutely gorgeous. The bistro sits amongst the beautiful Tohono Chul Park setting, so you get to enjoy beautiful flora and fauna of the Sonoran desert. On top of the beauty, it's so serene and quiet. And I love the architecture. A Spanish colonial style that's a bit rustic. We dined outside and it was just divine. Perfectly shaded. Beautiful scenery. 

Next, the food! The selection is unique and extensive, so I had a hard time deciding. I went with the chicken and waffles. Wow. I love how it comes with watermelon and I love how the waffle is made with blue corn flour. I devoured the whole thing. My friend got the prickly pear chicken and loved it. We both also enjoyed a prickly pear lemonade. The arresting fuchsia color of the drink alone makes it worth getting, but it's also delicious. Very refreshing. 

Service was perfect. Helpful, but not over imposing. Very relaxing. I think our server's name was Trevor. 

If I'm gushing this much, why just 4 stars? Well it's a bit pricy, so keep that in mind. My dish was $17.75 and the prickly pear lemonade was $4.75. So with tip I paid almost $30 just for myself for a lunch with my gal pal. The food is good and the atmosphere is just wonderful, so it's definitely worth it every once in a while! For the cost though, I can't justify coming here on a more regular basis. 

Other than the cost, the place is perfect! Plus you can eat at the bistro without paying entrance for the park. Highly recommend!!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,2,"First, let me explain that the low rating has nothing to do with the food or quality of our server. We had a lunch reservation for a largish group for a friend's birthday. A friend arrived early to decorate our tables, having been told there were tablecloths available. Upon arrival, she was told there were none. Finally some brown tablecloths were found. I arrived with a cake that needed be refrigerated. I waited at least 5 minutes, no host or hostess in sight. Finally a server who was bussing a table finally came through and took the cake. She had no knowledge of our reservation nor did she direct me to someone who did. 

Our server was friendly but clearly there should have been a second person assisting him. We waited on simple things like ice water and ranch dressing; napkins used to clean up a spilled drink were not cleared. To sum it up, I question the lack of anyone in the front of the house and the lack of servers. My croissant sandwich was very tasty but I can't say I'd recommend the Bistro for a big group.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"Love this place! Although it can be a bit pricey, the brunch dishes are to die for. The chicken and waffles are incredible. They are so flavorful and have a Southwestern twist to them. Yum! They also have prickly pear mimosas that are quite good! The atmosphere is quaint and charming and the service is good!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"This one's a lovely little bistro tucked away from the hustle bustle in the beautiful setting of the Tohono Chul park , which itself is a lovely place to visit! 
I loved having brunch twice over here , the food tasted good but the ambience is what I go back for ! Sitting on the outdoor patio even on a hot summer midday was very comforting with a lovely breeze coming through ! 
I would recommend for the beautiful outdoors and decent fare !",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,"Lovely patio garden seating if you want to eat while visiting the Tohono Chul Gardens! A little on the pricier side for brunch, but worth it for being able to be surrounded by beautiful plants and so many birds (great place to spot hummingbirds and cardinals). It is one of the places we take guests to enjoy outdoor brunch. The menu features fresh and local ingredients and some items rotate seasonally. For summer, I love that they have so many items incorporating watermelon. 

Thoughts on their current menu:
- Ricotta toast: good for if you want a hint of sweet, but something light - it's topped with strawberries, fig jam, toasted almonds, honey, and balsamic glaze with a watermelon salad on the side
- Mini Pancake Charcuterie: comes on a board and includes 6 mini pancakes, chocolate, assorted berries, bacon, nut butter - my husband's favorite
- Chicken and Blue Corn Waffles: for when you're craving savory, the chicken is pretty average, but the blue corn waffle is interesting (not too sweet with a hint of savory) and comes with a delicious side of tajin watermelon 

They also offer prickly pear mimosas and margaritas (even in bottomless option!) which are super tasty. Overall, we always enjoy our experience at the Garden Bistro!",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,3,Good atmosphere and all you can drink margaritas and bloody Mary's. Pretty sure potatoes were cross contaminated w meat so I did get sick as a vegetarian. Service was good as well. Could really use music 100% for better ambiance.,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"This is a very beautiful and relaxing place for lunch.  They offer two patios and indoor dining.  The inside dining area is also very nice.  If you want to escape the busy area of Ina and Oracle stop by the park for a great lunch.  The patio area is very quiet and today in mid December butterflies were flying around our table.  It is a true joy for us to eat here.  

The service here is always good and the prickly pear lemonade is great.  I really like the Chul burger with the regular fries that are seasoned.  We prefer the regular fries over the sweet potato fries.  

The prices are a bit higher than the local burger joints but to us this is a great value for the quality of the food and the ability to eat in such a wonderful place.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"Great food, great location, and great service! Had a lovely and lingering brunch with a friend. What a perfect place to sit outdoors and enjoy the butterflies! I ordered the Avocado Toast and added an egg. It was better than I would have expected. A work of art actually! Only the egg that I added was slightly overcooked. But I would forgive that since all the flavors were so delicious, and I didn't really notice. The Avocado Toast was on grilled ciabatta, with no skimping on the avocado. Also with roasted tomatoes, radishes, and a side salad with arugula and watermelon. The flavors were amazing. Also, the service was spot on. Just enough checking in, and anticipation of our needs (like bringing leftover boxes without being asked). Overall a lovely experience.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,4,All I have to say is $15 for an omelette!?!? It's okay and perfect for a quiet place to eat brunch. They have seating outside and inside but more tables outside. Nestled next to a gift shop and $13 tour. This is definitely something for people who enjoy the outdoors. Food is okay.,Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,1,"They do not follow proper covid protocols. It is insane that during the Omicron spike that they are forcing people to sit inside, tightly packed, when there are literally 30+ empty tables outside in the sun.",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
zsQ1_PNV3KN0EWhAE-WV9g,5,"What a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. We had 10 women celebrating a 75th birthday and we all agreed, it was an awesome, special experience! The food was amazing, the private room was perfect,  but best of all our server. Cat made us all feel special. She ran drinks, food, and helped us with dessert; all without missing a beat. We'd all been there before but this took all of our positive memories of this beautiful place and took it up 10 notches.  Thank you gour making our special day even better",Tohono Chul Garden Bistro
