The window didn't seal all the way so I heard the 101 freeway all night and a flock of crows starting at 4:30 AM even with earplugs in. I was hoping for a nice warm shower in the morning, but the water pressure was horrible and the hot water was hit and miss. The room was creepy and musty smelling. Tacky yard sale furniture throughout the building and rooms. It was dirty. I had to leave my weekend early because I got only 3 hours of sleep and had to drive back to LA early to miss the traffic so I didn't get into an accident from falling asleep. Avoid this place!! It's a nightmare!! What a waste of money!!!",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Things wrong with this room: large spider webs outside the room with bugs in the web that were either dead or alive, old sand bags directly across the room some of the bags were open and spilling out and others were closed, room had a stale smell, under the bed was large amounts of filth, crumbs and spider webs, had to kill two really large spiders that were visible to who were suppose to clean the room, sheets had stains but smelled clean, when we sat on the bed our bodies began to itch and we started to scratch, and the killer of them all the grand finale: There were a pair of dirty pink ladies underwear hanging in the closet.  

We left after only staying for 10 minutes because we did not want to take any critters home with us.  So we chose to drive 2 hours back home in the middle of the night instead of staying and becoming a hot bed for buds to bite our bodies.

If you are interested into the Norman Bates style hotel try this place.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,5,"I like the place. It's got character. It was 102 degrees outside this weekend but the AC did an amazing job keeping the room cool and the decorations added nice character. For the price this place can't be beat. If you want a 5 Star experience you probably shouldn't come here,but if you go anywhere else in SB it will be 5x the price.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,3,"This place is interesting. It's very cute outside, cottage looking and beautiful succulents and flowers everywhere. My friend and I decided on this place because of the price. Prior to arriving, I was a little iffy but again, it looked cute and quaint - also the price was budget friendly. However, upon arrival, we got into our room and the best way I was able to describe it to my friend was ""grandmas house"". I hate that it sounds like an insult, but it just smelled antique-y and dusty. My friend was not the biggest fan but I was able to tolerate it. I have this weird thing where I like to see if all bedside tables at hotels/motels/inns have bibles, but I opened the drawer and found a book and a note. The note frightened us at first, because it was addressed to someone who apparently was using someone else's CC to pay for storage units without consent. However, the person it was addressed to wasn't the owners name but they might want to do a better job at cleaning after every guest, because it probably would not have turned out well if it was someone else who found the note and thought the owner was being sketchy with our card information. ANYWAY, the water in the shower felt different, my friend thought so as well. I'm not sure how to describe it. But what bothered me most, was the bed. The mattress was wayyyy too firm and way too uncomfortable. Also, we went out at night and came back a little after midnight and we were locked out. Thankfully the owner came and opened the door but how annoying and unfortunate for her to have to wake up in the middle of the night just to let us in. The only enjoyable part of the stay was waking up to the sun rising and then having the sun beam against my face, it was therapeutic. But I won't be staying here again.",Summerland Inn

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,4,"Driving from San Francisco to Riverside is a long effing ride. So we pulled over in Santa Barbara and tried to find motels to crash in.

NO Vacancy. WTF. We keep driving and my trusty little iphone took us to summerland inn. It was about 1 am. The lady at the desk was super friendly and super nice. She said it would be $80 for the night and I gave her a look and said it is only 1 am and we were planing on leaving within the next 8 hours. She took the price down to $60. Thats what I like to hear.

The house itself is extremely kitschy. Theres an abundance of floral wall paper with tons of framed photographs, some baroque looking paintings and furniture mixed with ikea tables. The rooms were comfortable. The heater had been on though so we opened our windows to get some fresh air in. The tv's had a lot of channels and the bathrooms were extremely clean.

Free coffee and tea was made in the morning. 

I enjoyed this place and was very happy with the 9 hours I spent here haha. I felt like I was at my grandmas.",Summerland Inn

It spelled, it had poop on one bed spread and the other had blood stains! There was snail trail on the carpet AND the chair! The carpet wasn't even nailed down! We checked in for 10 minutes and then immediately checked out!

The place is dirty and cluttered. 

This place is unacceptable to me.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"This place you can tell was once nice however, I stayed recently. There was no hot water for a shower in the morning & no coffee. the room was nasty with rusted fixtures, mold on ceiling in the bath, pealing paint, filthy worn chairs, stained carpet.

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"the summerland inn is one thing. discusting. had such a bad feeling inside the rooms, that when we stayed, we slept in top of the covers. discusting place. i was very worried something was gonna happen to me and that's how uncomfortable i felt inside there. they should really put that place under construction and renovate the place because there was very old things on the walls, and the wallpapers were coming off the walls in the bathrooms. I was so insecure that I didn't even want to be inside the place.  I always wanted to be out somewhere. the fact that I was so insecure about the place, I wanted to sleep inside the car. discusting. they had very old covers, and just everything was very discusting and I felt very insecure. just straight discusting. do not think ANYONE should attend this place.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Horrible experience. More than outdated, mold on bathroom wallpaper and in shower. Although sink and sheets appeared clean, carpet and bathroom floor dirty, couch and two chairs so filthy didn't want to put suitcases down. Charged for room before we got keys, felt stuck because of late check in and already paid. Next time would leave with or without a refund. Paid $200 and wouldn't expect to pay $40/night for this level of disgust. I never write reviews but I want to spare others from having this horrible experience.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Absolutely horrible.  Chose it because of the price - less than $200/night - other hotels in the area start at $300 and go up (way up!).  Obviously you get what you pay for!!  

Place looks unkempt from the outside - and it gets worse when you go in!  Horrible, dirty, tacky decor probably from the early 1980s.  Dust everywhere, wallpaper peeling off the walls and the carpet was the worst - old, stained and I don't think it's been cleaned or vacuumed in years.  We were given Room #4 - enormous king bed, more tacky decor, worn out furniture.  Mold on the blinds in the bathroom, mold in the shower and I absolutely refused to walk without shoes on that carpet.  Just disgusting!!  One of the toiletries we were given was obviously used as well.

Avoid at all costs!  Pay the extra money and stay somewhere that doesn't bring on a wave of nausea!!",Summerland Inn

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Scam Artists Be Careful Using Debit Card!!!!!

I cannot even begin to comprehend how this place can pass a health inspection! I booked this hotel through an online site. I arrived at the motel and was surprised at how unkept the place looked. I went in to pay for my stay and was told that I had to pay an additional 50 dollars if I paid with a debit card? The person on duty was literally trying to scam me. I told him that the website I had booked through stated I would not be charged more at the motel. He said I had the option to leave but either way it would cost me $140 dollars for a cancellation fee. After arguing with him about this stupid scam he was trying to pull I left called the online booking agent and they confirmed there was a $140 cancellation fee, I explained he was trying to scam me with a fifty dollar fee and they told me he was not allowed to charge that fee. Long story short they called the motel, they confirmed he was trying to add extra charges and I was able to cancel free of charge.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,4,"One of the few places left with vacancies that didn't cost an arm and a leg on a three-day weekend.  The owner let us look at the rooms first and pick ours.

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,So much potential in this place. It is sad to see it hasn't gotten the TLC it so desperately needs. Carpet is very old and I couldn't stand walking on it with my bare feet. Everything just seems so old and outdated and dirty. Bed was comfy and sheets seemed clean though I didn't want to use the blankets. I wouldn't stay here again unless it got the updates and cleaning it needs.,Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,4,"This worked great for my family. This is move-in weekend at UCSB and everything in Santa Barbara was full or way too expensive. This was convenient in location and the room was clean. The towels were a bit wimpy, but a minor problem. This is not a luxury place, but completely appropriate for the price. We will come back. Easy to walk to several different cute places to eat!",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,3,"We've only stayed here once, which was last night, and I think we can see where all of the comments came from. Our expectations set the tone, probably ... we knew it was right next to the freeway, we knew it was an older Victorian-style place, and we knew it was $50 lower than the lowest price at any nearby places in the Santa Barbara area.

Not going to say we fell in love with the place, but it was nice enough, and we'll probably book there, in the future.

Fact is, the room we got was clean, well-equipped with a microwave and small refrig, bathroom was fine, bed was large and a bit squeeky, if you know what I mean, tv worked great, lots of charm, not too noisy, smelled fine, clean linens, didn't hear any of the neighbors until everyone started showering, in the morning ... in short ... not the Ritz, but didn't irritate us, either ... which is saying something. :)

Do not be afraid ... go ahead and book this place, if you want a decent room to crash in when you're doing something in the area and don't want to spend $50 more for a room for the night. Local eateries within reasonable walking distance aren't not too bad.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,3,"Rooms are horrifying and dirty. The website has pictures of the rooms and they look nothing like it in person. TV didn't work. Shower was out of hot water.

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,4,"I loved this place! Might not be for everybody, but I thought it was a charming quaint hotel. If you like antique stores, this is like staying in one! Actually, there's one literally right across the street! The furniture here is very dated, but in a good way. The hotel is meant to be like a trip back to early mid-century. Yes, it's fairly minimal in amenities, and the old furniture creeks and smells a little funny, but it's not overbearing in anyway. I see a lot of people complaining about this, but I think they're missing the point! It's meant to be that way! Like I mentioned, if you like antiques and the feeling of going back a few years, then this is a great, fun spot to stay in the Santa Barbara area. It's like being in an old Hitchcock movie, which I'm a huge fan of!",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Horrible phone customer service! I didn't stay there and I'm glad I didn't. I had made my reservation one and a half month in advance due to a busy college move in weekend.  I got a call from the hotel two days before my stay to tell me that my reservation had been cancelled and that they don't have a room for me cause they are all booked already. All they said was ""sorry"". Don't be surprise if they cancel your reservation and leave you without a room.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"This has to be the worst business I have ever dealt with. We booked a room, and then after reading the reviews, we tried to cancel. We got hung up on, a total of 9 times.

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,Not even worth it if you're absolutely desperate. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE SHITHOLE. The sheets were not clean and they were ripped. The whole place smells like urine and old people. And not the good kind of old people...and urine.,Summerland Inn

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,This inn was awful- it was dusty and stuffy. Our room smelled like smoke and there were dirty Q-tips on the bathroom floor. After finally checking in and exploring downtown a little bit we decided we wanted to stay some where else. The lady would not give us a refund and proceeded to yell at us and then hang up on us after we told her we were not satisfied. I DO NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE! I should've read the Yelp reviews before..,Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,2,"There was no air conditioning, so the upstairs tiny room felt like a hot oven  and although they provided multiple fans, it still was too hot. In addition, the bedframe sticks out on the bottom corner so far they have little pillows tied to them, but even then, it was inevitable that you would bang your  shins on them trying to negotiate the tiny space around the bed. I found it also interesting that the small refridgerator was dirty and was resting on something unevenly versus sitting on a countertop. The only saving grace was that the mattress was decently comfortable and that Summerland is very easy in there  traffic department. I would recommend driving down the highway or up the highway and spend a couple extra dollars to get something more realistic and comfortable.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,5,"This is the fourth time I am staying here in the last few years. It's been amazing as it has been. I didn't read too many of existing reviews but I know people might feel about a place differently. For me, deeply, my trip doesn't start until I have the room here booked. It's a beautiful b/b off the fwy, outside of busy Santa Barbara yet close enough to get there in a few minutes. The rooms are decorated with bit antique feel. I have stayed in two or three different rooms and if I remember correctly, they are all nicely different. Opening the window before going to bed invites the breeze from the sea. Free coffee down stairs in the morning does feel like waking up from a cozzy house I ever had. Book here! The cutely loud lady is fun and wonderful to get along with once you get to know her!",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,Was out here for a graduation and stayed here overnight and I was not happy honestly for several reasons. First of all the front desk lady seemed rude and does not speak good English. The steps outside seemed like they were loose and the room was very old fashioned with no fan a terrible air conditioner and it needs to be updated because everything inside is outdated. Also by the window there was a razor blade that was left which seemed odd to me. I honestly wouldn't recommend for anyone to stay here.,Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"I've never felt so unsafe in a hotel room. There was clearly the sound of water dripping from the upstairs room - not in pipes, but like an automatic coffee maker. It sounded like it was dripping into the room, which would explain the wet carpet and funky smell. I was afraid the ceiling would come down onto our bed, and seriously wondered if we would be safer sleeping in the car. For $200/night, we shouldn't feel that way. In the morning light we clearly saw where the ceiling had been patched - obviously didn't fix the problem.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"This was the worst hotel experience of my life. I worked in hotels and was disgusted by the lack of cleanliness in our room and the horrible customer service. Our sheets were dirty, the floor of our room had crumbs, food and dust, there were wires just hanging out that connected to the fridge and television. Our fridge was dirty, there were ants in our sink, and the shower water did not even work. We were asked to pull really hard to start it. We were in the room for 30 minutes before we decided to leave and we were only refunded half of what we payed. I would not recommend this place.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Horrible, dirty and disgusting. The owner was very very difficult to understand, and not accommodating at all. There is so much I can say about this disgusting place, but the one that sticks out the most is when we could not get the tv working and she sent up who we had thought was a homeless man loitering out front, to fix it. He was aggravated much of the almost two hours he took to fix the tv and we finally went downstairs to let him finish. I guess while he was battling reaching behind the tv to hook it up, his knuckles began to bleed from scraping the wall. That was bad enough, but the worst is he NEVER cleaned the blood off the wall! He left it there. Our tv worked but there was blood running down the wall and left there. Can you imagine? I wasn't about to try to clean it up. The entire place was filthy, we didn't dare sleep on the sheets or even the bedspread. We luckily brought a sleeping bag and slept on that. The furniture all looked like it was from a thrift store and the glass country lamp hanging above the table was broken and the sharp shard of glass left there. If I didn't have to leave any stars I wouldn't even do 1. I will be reporting this place to the health dept.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Honestly if I can give this place zero stars I would. My boyfriend and I were in Santa Barbara over the weekend and we were originally going to stay for just 1 night. But decided to stay another night so I went on booking.com to find a cheap place. And this place popped up. I booked it and it was a bad idea. Just pulling up looked sketchy. And when we were in the lobby... it got worse. Just the vibe of that place sent chills down my spine and made me uncomfortable to stay there. So I told my boyfriend that I didn't feel safe and let's find another place to stay. The lady who helped us which it seemed she was the owner seemed a little off. When I gave her my card to pay she had to go to the back room to charge me. Which is odd... and when I said Nevermind cancel payment. We are going somewhere else she seemed confused. She didn't want to give me my refund back. But she reversed it which is good. And after that she asked for my boyfriends credit card! Like what?! Why?? We are leaving. Why charge his card when clearly I had the funds on my card and have the nerve to ask him for his card? No way. 
I'm glad we didn't end up staying there. And went somewhere else that was cheaper and safe. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Read the reviews first. That's what I should of done first.",Summerland Inn

Awesome location to walking distance to Lookout park and beach access, but that's the only highlight.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"This IS the worse experience in my life. It is SO noisy, it's like not sleeping at all. Nothing worked, no air conditioning, tv control, refrigerator.... nothing. There is never a person at the front desk and the person that comes out to open the door is half asleep. Probably from not being able to sleep due to all the noise from the freeway.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Needed a room for the night last weekend.  The area was pretty booked.  Reserved this place for $160.  $176 after tax.

Get there... ""meh, pretty kitch, next to the freeway, but... it's fine I guess."" 

... 20 minutes later, the 40lb mirror falls off the wall randomly (we were standing at the other side of the room).  Turns out it hadn't been hung right.  Instead of hanging it by the wire, someone had accidentally hung it precariously by just the frame.  OK.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Could have injured a kid or severed a toe.  (literally).  But not this time.  Good.  For everyone. 

The real kicker was getting woken up at 4:15am or so by the TV in the room next door.  We were in #6.  The person in #7 had been listening to TV all night, but suddenly it got much louder.  We both woke up.  Thought... ""it'll get quiet, we'll wait it out.""  4:45am I finally get out of bed and go downstairs to find a manager to do something about it.  No one around.  I go back to my room and try calling the manager using the room phone.  No one picks up.  I call the hotel on their outside line, using my cell phone.  Still no one picks up.  Some people at this point would just knock on the door of the offending room.  Frankly, I wasn't feeling very confrontational at 4:45am, and not eager to deal with a potentially-belligerent stranger.  Lay there.  Listening to TV dialog through the wall.  Pretty sure the room #7 TV is right opposite the wall of the bed in Room #6.  ... The TV show that came on at 5am wasn't quite as loud.  We were able to go back to sleep intermittently, but woke up several times throughout the early morning.

9:30 finally get up.  Annoyed.  Sleepless.  Not rested.  TV still on next door.  Resign ourselves to showering and leaving ASAP.  Comically bad night's sleep.  (And I sleep like a rock).

last straw- no hot water.  take an awesome cold shower.  Just what I needed after a sleepless night.  Or not.

Go downstairs.  Explain to the hostess that 
a) the mirror dangerously fell off the wall.  Could really hurt someone.
b) the tv was on next door all night, i tried to find someone to talk to, to no avail.
c) there was no hot water in the morning.
d) i really had no choice but to write a review.  (i rarely write reviews.  usually only for places I really dig.  Never to knock a place- we all have bad days, etc.  But this was too much).

She was asian.  Not very good english.  I don't know if she understood everything I said to her, but at least 75% it seemed.

she said sorry.  said she would call the manager.  

worst $180 i've ever spent on lodging.  

I know mirrors get mis-hung.  OK.  And I know the TV issue wasn't entirely their fault; sometimes you get bad customers.  You can't control who walks through the door.  But the Inn should still have someone available to deal with problems, regardless of the time of day or night.  And the cold water.  well... 

I probably won't be going back.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"So I ended up booking this room online for a whopping 200 dollars a night to spend the night before heading to L.A. I booked this hotel because the pictures on the website were absolutely beautiful however when I arrived I  realized how deceived I was. First off the hotel looks on the outside more like Bates Motel than a reputable establishment. The sign is in tatters and there are weeds everywhere along with some birds (yes real birds and they freak out when you go near them) sitting in a cage by the front door. The woman who walked up didn't have any shoes on and looked as if she had just gotten out of bed. When I followed her to the front desk I was greeted by a very spooky doll swinging on a toy swing from the rafters. When I saw the doll I was already massively creeped out but let it go and told the woman about my reservation that I had. She didn't even bother looking for a reservation instead just said okay and took my card. She then directed me to room 2 and handed me my key, the key was not a keycard but instead an old literal key. When I got to the room I was sorely disappointed. The room looked like an old room at a grandmothers house and was very dusty and old. There was no air conditioning instead I got a box that you had to put ice and water in and that provided you air conditioning (good luck finding ice for it though). The windows were broken and would not close or latch and one of the chairs was also busted. The room had two different beds both of which were pretty uncomfortable. What really got me was that the peephole to the room had absolutely no glass covering it. Instead it had a piece of toilet paper in place of the glass to cover the hole. I was pretty creeped out by the place and decided to eat my 200 bucks rather than stay there. The place just had a huge horror movie feel to it and I just felt super creeped out. I should've read the yelp reviews before buying my room because this place did NOT match the pictures I was sent. Horrible experience and I ended up finding another hotel to stay at rather than spend the night at this creepshow. Please do not make the same mistake I made instead find another hotel!!!!",Summerland Inn

v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,3,"SB was completely booked so my boyfriend and I chose Summerland Inn. This place cracked me up. I felt like I was in a game of iSpy with the different funny things all around the property and in the rooms. Towels had stains and very old looking furniture that felt like it might fall apart on you BUT the bed was comfortable. The owner was cute and a bit confusing but we got our room and overall enjoyed it. Great view from room. Oh yeah if you have two beds in your room but only need one done use other bed or she will charge a linen fee of $30. Also, if your toilet wont flush check to make sure the water is turned on, she turned it off to save water. It'd be easy for someone to think the hotel was creepy, but I'd like to call it charming instead. Charming and funny. Thanks Summerland Inn for the 1 nighter!",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,4,"My husband and I liked this funny place because it felt like staying at Grandmas house. Creaky, busy wallpaper but cozy. No bed bugs to be found. The front desk lady was nice and accommodating. This place is not the ritz but a sleepy little funky inn at the end of town.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Imagine spending the night in your great aunt's old, creepy, never updated home right after her funeral. This place is the bed and breakfast (without breakfast) of last resort. Checking in, the lobby was filled with the ambiance of a Chinese language TV show loudly emanating from an adjacent room. The fireplace mantel was festooned with several religious statues from Buddha to Vishnu and many in between along with a troop of waving cat figures. A reanimated Madam Wu took our credit card and provided the door key. 

We requested a king room, but received a ""Stephen King"" house of horror room. The room decor was garish with fruity wallpaper and dark mauve carpeting. The virtual antique 24"" TV/VHS/DVD combo with grainy picture belied the free wifi available in the room. The bathroom, with peeling paint, buckled tiles and evidence of mold gave the feeling of needing a shower after you've showered. However, what puts this place over the top was the infestation of roaches. I counted 7 during our 10 hour stay. Some living in the toilet tank (coming out when the toilet flushed) and some in the bedroom area (including one ON the bed itself). I picked up my shoes off the floor to put them on and two roaches were hiding underneath- Ick!!!! It was completely and utterly disgusting. I only recommend this place as a step up from sleeping in your car. Even then I hesitate. You've been warned.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,2,"We booked this place for 2 nights at the last minute. It wasn't very expensive and there was a reason why. It had an odor, it wasn't very clean, wasn't sure if the room was cleaned before we arrived. Sheets were dirty and had stains on them. Comforter was about 20 years old. People were renting a room to live in below us. Not a first class place, but not a terrible place either.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Do NOT stay here.  Rooms do not match photos at all.  I paid for a room with King bed + wireless internet.  The room I was given was in a different building with 2 saggy beds, a strange locked door inside the closet leading to who knows what and no wireless internet signal. The provided toiletries were a joke - there was an empty soap wrapper + 1 old travel size shampoo tube.  There was sticky residue on the floor inside the room's front door.  The traffic noise from 101 was right outside the window.  Sketchy residents living in the converted garages on the lower level.  

When I asked the owner for another room with Internet, she pretended she didn't speak English and said no vacancy.  I pointed to the Vacancy sign outside the hotel's front door.  She walked to it and flipped it to no vacancy.

Was horrified to see Yelp reviews with photos of bed bugs and blood from a recently as 9 months ago.  

Because I reserved the room through Priceline, Priceline had to contact the owner to confirm the refund.  Priceline repeatedly called the hotel but the owner did not pick up the phone. I had to endure the hassle of getting connected to Priceline's Chinese department, stand in the hotel office and get the owner to pick up the hotel phone when Priceline called.  

Spend the money to stay elsewhere.  The money savings staying here is absolutely not worth it.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"This was the worst hotel I have ever seen. When we arrived around 2:00 the door was locked to the office. We rang the bell twice but nothing so we called the phone number. A man arrived at the door (I think he just woke up) he welcomed us in. The lobby smelled musty, old and immediately I was thinking we made a huge mistake booking this place. We did check in and went immediately to check our room before we gathered our things. Disgusting!! The furniture was not antiques it was just old crappy furniture. There was a block of wood under the leg of a table to level it. Furniture was dirty. Floor was dirty. Bed looked dilapidated, I did not sit on it, sheets were not tucked in, the bedspread was awful. First thing that went thru my mind was I wondered if the beds had bed bugs. There were electric cords running all over the walls. Lights did not work. Wallpaper was torn, paint was coming off the wall. The place smelled. There was absolutely no way I could sleep in this room. We headed back to the office to find the man who checked us in and told him we could not stay here. He voided my transaction for the room and we left. We were stunned and in disbelief of what we just witnessed. STAY ELSEWHERE!!!!!! This place is not fit for humans.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"OMG!!! The place is very dirty and smelly. Smells like dog pee. The carpet has dark stains from the bottom of the stairs to the hallway to the rooms. I told my kids not to walk around the room without shoes. 

The front desk carpet has stains and very disgusting.

Our room #5, has a small ""a/c"" unit and it was not cooling. The owner said ""we have to put ice in the bucket underneath to get cool air circulating"" .  Then gave us an extra fan just in case it does not cool off ! A/C never cooled off! 

The bathtub was not draining well, it took 5 minutes for the water to completely go down. GROSS!

Then we had a double bed and one bed is ""rock hard"" !

We paid $150 for the night plus tax. I asked for another room but she said ""there's no more room available"" but on the sign outside it said vacancy! 

It was a bad experience. I wanted to give no star but I have to put one star to be able to write this review.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"God Awful.


Horrible, old , crusty , outdated , and just plain tacky. 


Needs renovations desperately! 



I have bruises on my legs from the stupid bed that I kept hitting my legs on since the bed sticks out so far. 


The room is hot and musty. 


Will never come back. 


Stay far far away. 


Wished I would have read the reviews first. 


They even use old keys for the rooms. 


No breakfast 



No toiletries worth using. Crusty old bar soap from 20 years ago



Dust everywhere


Just plain tacky!! Especially for over 100. 


Like staying at your unclean Grandmothers house but you do not want to be rude and say anything.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"If you don't mind not having an updated room for 40 years look, mold on shower door, dirty floor, toiletries consisted of gum sized bath soap, and a greasy 2 ounce bottle of shampoo, paint peeling from bathroom ceiling, different textured blankets and colors, not sure if bedding was clean, odd old smell, then stay there. 

I spent $200 for one night and I could have slept in my car and gotten a good nights sleep.  For free too.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"DO NOT STAY HERE.  ROACHES IN THE ROOM, ON THE WALL, FLOOR, AND IN THE BED.  Besides the carpet being disgusting and a nasty smell in the lobby and staircase, the room was only surface cleaned.  If you looked in the corners, the dust was piled high.  We couldn't believe what we saw and smelled, but when we started seeing roaches, we couldn't leave fast enough.  I am still sickened that I had been in this room.  I even washed my suitcases upon getting home.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,Place is absolutely disgusting. Never thought id see some shit like this. The place reeks of old. Smells like a funeral home. Spiders galore in the bathroom.,Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,"Very bad. Seems to be run by an elderly woman, and the upkeep is too much for her. The place needs maintenance. The other reviews seem accurate.  Our room had used, wet towels, trash in the trashcan, and an odd assortment of blankets on the bed. Were there sheets? I'm not sure. Were they clean? I don't know but, I'd bet no. We had room #6 and the freeway noise was actually not bad. However, we could hear all the conversation and tv from the room next to us. 

Also, I get that the owners don't want to maintain the place, but the smoke alarm in the hall way was going off with a low battery beep that was easily heard from our room, and I assume all the rooms. I mean, seriously, you run an inn, and leave a beeping alarm in the hallway? That was kind of a slap in the face. Why am I paying you? This, taken with the dirty room and everything, just makes this place a very poor place to stay, but it is relatively cheap. The crazy thing is, its still not cheap in absolute terms. We paid $125 for the night. 

The place is prob still a good value if you bring your own towels and bedding. Hotels are very expensive in the area. We made the mistake of not bringing a towel and bedding and so we left without staying the night...an expensive mistake.",Summerland Inn
v2L2HnZzYvHPgFcVBg2TUw,1,I agree with the 0 star review. My family had to relocate in the middle of the night after finding a bed bug crawling across my mother's pillow. Even worse I found another one on one of my clean shirts  after scalding myself in a hot shower at the new hotel. This is repulsive and this place should be shut down. This place is not acceptable for humans.,Summerland Inn
